h1. uDig Overview

The User-friendly Desktop Internet GIS (uDig) is an open source ("EPL":http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html + "BSD":http://udig.refractions.net/files/bsd3-v10.html) desktop application framework, built with the Eclipse Rich Client (RCP) technology.

* uDig can be used as a stand-alone application
* uDig can be extended with RCP "plug-ins"
* uDig can be used as a plug-in in an existing RCP application

uDig is an open project, with developers from multiple companies participating in the decision making process and project direction. All decisions are made transparently, on the public mailing list, or in open "IRC":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC discussions.

h2. Project Outline

The goal of uDig is to provide a complete Java solution for desktop GIS data access, editing, and viewing. uDig aims to be:
* <b>U</b>ser friendly, providing a familiar graphical environment for GIS users;
* <b>D</b>esktop located, running as a thick client, natively on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux;
* <b>I</b>nternet oriented, consuming standard (WMS, WFS, WCS) and de facto (GeoRSS, KML, tiles) geospatial web services; and,
* <b>G</b>IS ready, providing the framework on which complex analytical capabilities can be built, and gradually subsuming those capabilities into the main application.

There are two ways to take part: indirectly using github pull requests; and directly by obtaining commit access. Remember that a pull request is the start of a conversation!

h1. Build Instructions

1. We have two branches in our short term roadmap:
   
   * https://github.com/locationtech/udig-platform (luna)

   <pre><code>
     git https://github.com/locationtech/udig-platform udig
     cd udig
     git checkout master
   </pre></code>

2. Download stuff (using maven to launch small ant download scripts):
   <pre><code>
     mvn clean install -f pom-libs.xml

     [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
     [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   </code></pre>

3. Upload to website

See results at http://udig.refractions.net/download/unstable/ there should be a 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT by the time you read this.

4. To test an individual module::
      
      cd plugins/org.locationtech.catalog.tests.ui
      mvn clean install -Ptest -fae

h2. Option - Eclipse Build

We have tested these instructions with Eclipse 4.3 Kepler.

We have found incompatibilities with target definition when trying newer versions of Eclipse.


h3. Preferences

From the Eclipse **Preferences** screen:

1. **Java --> Code Style --> Coding Template**
     
   Use the **Import** button and select the file `extras/org.locationtech.udig.dev/codetemplates.xml`
     
   Confirm the uDig header is available for **New Java Files** as shown::
<pre><code>/* uDig - User Friendly Desktop Internet GIS client

h3. Target Platform and Running uDig

uDig makes use of a target platform, in order to download and reference bundles from:

* Eclipse Rich Client Platform (Indigo or Luna)
* Babel Project (providing translations)
* Orbit (open source components that have been checked by the Eclipse legal team)

Here is how to set that up:

1. Use the **Import Existing Projects** wizard to import the targets/indigo project into workspace.

!extras/images/import_projects_targets.png!

2. Open up udig-indigo-target.target and click on Set as Target Platform

!extras/images/target.png!

This will reset the target platform which will take some time.
   
3. Save a copy of the target-platform locally

Since the target definition uses online resources it's a good idea to export it for offline development purposes.
To do so, click on the export action top right in the target platform editor.
  
!extras/images/export-target-platform-01.png!

Choose a destination folder to store features and bundles as a local P2 repository resolved via the target defintion file.

!extras/images/export-target-platform-02.png!

Later if there is a need to work offline you can easily create a new target platform definion, for details consult "eclipse online help":http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fguide%2Ftools%2Fpreference_pages%2Ftarget_platform.htm.

4. Once the target platform is finished you can import the remaining uDig projects.

5. Open up *org.locationtech.udig/udig.product* and click *Launch the product*

!extras/images/product.png!

Tips:

* Edit your Run Configuration to turn on tracing when debugging
* Check your Run Configuration has been created with Java 7

h3. Find Bugs

We use **FindBugs** to catch many small issues as part of our review process:

1. Select **Help --> Eclipse marketplace** from the menu bar
2. Search for **FindBugs** and Install
3. You will be asked to restart eclipse

Take a moment to run **FindBugs** before submitting a pull request.
