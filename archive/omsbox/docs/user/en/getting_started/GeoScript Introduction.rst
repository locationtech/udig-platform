GeoScript Introduction
----------------------

Scripting is one of the powerful things in GIS. Non developers have the possibility
to automate common tasks.

The `geoscript <http://geoscript.org/>`_ scripting engine can be used
from within uDig to do geo-scripting.

* :doc:`/reference/GeoScript editor`
* `geoscript <http://geoscript.org/>`_ 

**Limitations**

* CSV Readers and Writers from **geoscript.layer.io** are not supported at the moment.


Open the GeoScript editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Two icons can be used to open the scripting editor: one for creating a new empty script
   and one to open an existing script.

   .. image:: /images/geoscript_editor/01_open_editor.png

#. Let's create a new one. The you will be prompted to save the new script to
   file and an empty editor is opened.

#. There are a few tool inside the editor, needed to start and stop scripts, or set the heap memory
   allowed to be used by a script or enable logging.

Using the editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the editor open you are free to script away, with command completion and syntax coloring
as described below.

#. Inside the editor command completion is available for common geoscript objects.
   
   Type the following into your editor::
   
      import geoscript.geom.*
      
      Geo
   
#. Select **Geometry** from the list of suggestions and press :kbd:`Enter` to activate command completion.
   
   .. figure:: /images/geoscript_editor/03_complete_class.png
      :width: 80%

#. Command completion is also available for methods.

   Continue to type the following into your editor::

      import geoscript.geom.*
      
      Geometry.fr

#. Select the **from WKT** method from the list of selection and press :kbd:`Enter`.

   .. figure:: /images/geoscript_editor/04_complete_method.png
      :width: 80%

#. When using command completion:
  
   * the first completion proposals that start with the inserted text are suggested
   * next the suggestions that simply contain the text
   
#. While using the editor Syntax coloring is used to highlight keywords and improve readability.

   Complete your script with the following::
      
      import geoscript.geom.*
      
      poly4 = Geometry.fromWKT("POLYGON ((0 0, 8 0, 8 8, 0 8, 0 0))")
      poly5 = Geometry.fromWKT("POLYGON ((5 5, 13 5, 13 13, 5 13, 5 5))")
      poly6 = poly4.intersection(poly5)
      
      println "Intersection: " + poly 6
      
   You can use Syntax coloring as visual feedback while typing to double check your script
   for typos.

Run your script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Once you have completed your script, push the :guilabel:`Start` button.
   
   The script will be run through the Spatial Toolbox engine and the output displayed
   in the **Console view**.

#. The script creates two polygons, and generates their intersection.

Import common modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geoscript needs you to define the modules you want to use in your
script through the import directive, which is usually placed at
the top of the script.

#. Try and plot the result by adding the following to your script::

      import geoscript.geom.*
      
      poly4 = Geometry.fromWKT("POLYGON ((0 0, 8 0, 8 8, 0 8, 0 0))")
      poly5 = Geometry.fromWKT("POLYGON ((5 5, 13 5, 13 13, 5 13, 5 5))")
      poly6 = poly4.intersection(poly5)
      
      println "Intersection: " + poly 6
      
      Plot.plot([poly6,poly5,poly4])

#. Press **Start** to try out this change.

   It will fail, because the plot module was not imported:

   .. figure:: /images/geoscript_editor/06_missing_imports.png
      :width: 80%

#. The editor supplies a quick way to import the most common modules, which
   can be useful when starting with the scripting as way to learn what
   modules are available.
   
   Push the **Import** button at the right of the **Stop** button and the
   imports are added to the top of your script.
   
#. Press **Start** to try your script again now that it includes the **Plot** import.

Geoscript Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `GeoScript Project <http://geoscript.org/>`_ allows for some fun, the best way to get into it is to start
from the web site tutorial page:

* http://geoscript.org/tutorials

Just to add one more complex example, lets see a script that can render a map, properly styled, to an image:
