<h1>The Eclipse Test Framework</h1>
<p>Last Modified: Feb. 26, 2003</p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
  Introduction</font></p>
<p>The testing framework is comprised of the org.eclipse.test plugin and the org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit 
  fragment. </p>
<p>These two projects are available from the dev.eclipse.org repository and are 
  included in the eclipse-Automated-Tests.&lt;buildid&gt;.zip from the eclipse.org 
  downloads page.</p>
<p><font size="+1">Building and Installation</font></p>
<p>Since the org.eclipse.test plugin is stored in the repository in source-code 
  form, it needs to be compiled before it can be used. The org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit 
  fragment does not contain any source and can be used as is from the repository.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn of automatic builds. Window->Preferences->Workbench and uncheck "Perform 
    build automatically on resource modification"</li>
  <li>Load org.eclipse.test into your workspace.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the org.eclipse.test project in either the Navigator or Packages 
    view. Select 'Rebuild Project' from the context menu. This will compile the 
    entire org.eclipse.test plugin.</li>
  <li>Finally, copy the org.eclipse.test plugin into your target Eclipse.</li>
  <li>The org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit fragment only needs to be present in 
    the environment of the Eclipse that is overseeing the test process. If you 
    are running the test script from within the Workbench, this means that the 
    fragments need to be present withinn your development Eclipse. If you are 
    running the tests from the command line, then the fragments will need to be 
    present in your target Eclipse.</li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Setup</font></p>
<p>Follow the steps given above to build and install all of the neccessary plugins 
  and fragments. Please note that the current version of the test framework is 
  not compatible with the PDE notion of self-hosting. If you want to run the tests, 
  you will need to setup a full target Eclipse so that the testing framework can 
  detect everything that is needed.</p>

<p>If you are writing tests for one or more Eclipse plugins, then you should
create a separate plugin for tests. The test plugin will contain all of the
tests that will be run on your development plugins, as well as defining how
those tests get run.</p>

<p>If you are not writing tests for an Eclipse plugin, then you should look into 
  using JUnit on its own to test your work. JUnit is designed for testing Java 
  code, and by default has no knowledge of Eclipse. There are separate mechanisms 
  for using JUnit on Java code in Eclipse. See the documentation provided here:</p>
<p> <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-ui-home/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.junit/index.html">JUnit 
  Support in Eclipse</a><br>
  <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org:8080/help/content/help:/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-207.htm?resultof=%6a%75%6e%69%74%20&toc=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftoc.xml">Using 
  JUnit</a></p>

<p>Once a test plugin has been created, you must then create an Ant script that 
  will run all of the tests. Create a file called 'test.xml', which is a sibling 
  of 'plugin.xml'. This file defines how each test is going to be run. The 'test.xml' 
  file is like a DOS batch file that scripts the entire testing process. Typically, 
  the 'test.xml' file will contain targets for setting up the test run, executing 
  the tests, cleaning up afterwards, and running the entire process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">Converting existing Test Suites</font></p>

<p>If you are converting an existing set of tests to use the new framework, the
actual tests that have been written should not need much change.</p>

<p>If you have tests in multiple plugins, it is helpful to designate one plugin
as the main plugin for your component. This can be one of your existing
plugins, or it can be a new plugin, created specifically for this purpose. Your
main plugin is the only plugin that needs to contain a 'test.xml' script. This
script can invoke the tests in each of your other plugins, so there is no need
for multiple scripts. Your main plugin does not need to depend on your other
plugins at all.</p>

<p>Make sure that the tests are defined in a plugin. This is probably the most 
  common cause of confusion in the entire test process. Your tests need to be 
  in a plugin so that Eclipse can find them when it tries to load them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">Creating new Test Suites</font></p>
<p>Creating new JUnit tests for an Eclipse plugin should be no more difficult 
  than writing standard JUnit tests. Since the framework allows tests to be run 
  inside of a working Eclipse, any tests that you write have available to them 
  any of the methods supplied by the Eclipse platform, provided that you add the 
  appropriate dependencies to your tests' 'plugin.xml'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">Performance Issues</font></p>
<p>You should keep in mind the number of times that Eclipse needs to be
started. Launching Eclipse has a substantial cost in terms of runtime. To
minimize the number of times the platform is started, you should consider
writing a TestSuite called AllTests for each of your test plugins. AllTests
should invoke each of the tests that you want to run for a particular plugin.
The 'test.xml' file can then run the AllTests class, which will run all of your
tests, but the platform will only ever be started once for each of your test
plugins.</p>

<p>Note: Sometimes tests involve shutting down, restarting, and testing the state 
  of metadata that was written to disk. These session tests will require Eclipse 
  to be launched several times in sequence, which will increase the runtime of 
  your tests. This cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">Running the Test Suite from the UI</font></p>
<p>Right click on the test.xml file and select 'Run Ant...' from the pull-down 
  menu. The Running Ant dialog box pops up. From the list of targets, select the 
  one that runs all of your tests. If you are using the example file provided 
  below, this target is called 'Run', and will be selected by default. Hit the 
  'Finish' button to start the test process.</p>
<p><font size="+1">Running the Test Suite from the command line</font></p>
<p>When the test suites are invoked automatically, they are run from command
line. From the ${eclipse-home} directory, the command to use is:</p>

<code>java -cp
startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.UIMain -application
org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -buildfile ${test-plugin-path}\test.xml
-Declipse-home=${eclipse-home}</code>

<p>Individual tests can also be invoked directly. From the ${eclipse-home}
directory, use the command:</p>

<code>java -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.UIMain -application ${launcher} 
-dev bin -testlistener org.eclipse.test.XMLTestListener -testpluginname ${plugin-name} 
-classname ${test-classname}</code> 
<p>where ${launcher} is one of: <i>org.eclipse.test.uitestapplication</i> or <i>org.eclipse.test.coretestapplication</i> 
  depending on whether or not you want to run your tests within an active Workbench.</p>
<p><font size="+1">Output</font></p>

<p>By default, output from each test run is logged as XML. For each test that 
  is run, the output is logged into the file called ${classname}.xml. The individual 
  XML files are located in the ${eclipse-home} directory. When the test run is 
  finished, you can call the <b>&quot;collect&quot;</b> target in the library 
  file, which will collect the XML into a single file. See below for an example 
  of how to use this target correctly.</p>

<p>The JUnit integration in Eclipse supports various advanced features, such as
<b>Regression Testing</b>, <b>Email Notification</b>, and <b>HTML Output</b>.
These features are currently under development, and do not yet have a
standardized way to add them to a test run.</p>

<h3>Other issues</h3>

<h4>Headless Testing vs. UI testing</h4>

<p>Many plugin tests will not need the Workbench active in order to run. Indeed, 
  only the minimum number of plugins needed to run the plugin being tested need 
  to be present when testing in a target Eclipse. There are two different Ant 
  targets provided for running Eclipse plugin tests. One target starts the entire 
  Workbench. The other starts Eclipse with the minimum number of plugins needed. 
  It is up to you to decide which target is most appropriate. For examples, look 
  at the <b>&quot;ui-test&quot;</b> and <b>&quot;core-test&quot;</b> targets below.</p>

<h4>Disposing the Display</h4>

<p>Some low-level tests for the Eclipse platform take actions that are not
normally possible inside of Eclipse. An example of this behaviour would be
disposing the display. While this action can be performed while running the UI,
it will also kill the UI for the copy of Eclipse that is running, and cause
errors when the Workbench tries to shutdown. If you need to test disposing the
display, or other similar actions, your tests should be running without a UI. </p>

<h4>Tests that are not plugins</h4>

<p>It is very easy to forget to define your tests inside of a plugin. If your 
  tests will not load properly, make sure that a 'plugin.xml' file exists in your 
  test project, and also that the plugin is being loaded by the platform. Make 
  sure that all of the dependencies are satisfied for your test plugin.</p>
<p><font size="+1">Interface</font></p>

<p>The org.eclipse.test plugin defines many useful Ant tasks/targets to aid developers 
  in writing their test.xml scripts. Currently, there is only Ant targets defined, 
  which can be called using Ant's built-in &lt;ant&gt; task. To use these targets, 
  add the following line to the top of your script, and reference the ${library-file} 
  property when calling &lt;ant&gt;:</p>

<code>&lt;property name=&quot;library-file&quot;
value=&quot;${eclipse-home}/fragments/org.eclipse.test/library.xml&quot;/&gt; </code>

<p>The targets that are defined are: </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>ui-test</b> - This target runs a JUnit test suite inside of an Eclipse 
    Workbench. This target is mainly for testing plugins that use the Eclipse 
    UI and JFace. The output of the test pass is automatically logged in an XML 
    file called ${classname}.xml. It takes four arguments: </li>
 <ul>
  <li><i>data-dir</i> - The
      data directory of the Eclipse that gets run</li>
  <li><i>plugin-name</i> -
      The name of the plugin that the test suite is defined in</li>
  <li><i>classname</i> -
      The name of the class that the test suite is defined in</li>
  <li><i>vmargs</i> - An
      optional argument string to pass to the VM running the tests</li>
 </ul>

<p>For example, the following code will run the test
org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest in the plugin org.eclipse.foo in a new Eclipse
workbench. It passes the string &quot;-Dbaz=true&quot; to the VM. The Eclipse
stores its metadata in the directory &quot;data-folder&quot;. 

<code><pre>
&lt;ant target=&quot;ui-test&quot; antfile=&quot;${library-file}&quot; dir=&quot;${eclipse-home}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;data-dir&quot; value=&quot;data-folder&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;plugin-name&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.foo&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;classname&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;vmargs&quot; value=&quot;-Dbaz=true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</pre></code>

  <li><b>core-test</b> - This target runs a JUnit test suite inside of an IPlatformRunnable. 
    This target is for testing plugins that use the Eclipse platform, but do not 
    require a UI to be running. The output of the test pass is automatically logged 
    in an XML file called ${classname}.xml. It takes four arguments: </li>
 <ul>
  <li><i>data-dir</i> - The
      data directory of the Eclipse that gets run</li>
  <li><i>plugin-name</i> -
      The name of the plugin that the test suite is defined in</li>
  <li><i>classname</i> -
      The name of the class that the test suite is defined in</li>
  <li><i>vmargs</i> - An
      optional argument string to pass to the VM running the tests</li>
 </ul>

<p>For example, the following code will run the test
org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest in the plugin org.eclipse.foo in a headless Eclipse.
It passes the string &quot;-Dbaz=true&quot; to the VM. The Eclipse stores its
metadata in the directory &quot;data-folder&quot;.

<code><pre>
&lt;ant target=&quot;core-test&quot; antfile=&quot;${library-file}&quot; dir=&quot;${eclipse-home}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;data-dir&quot; value=&quot;data-folder&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;plugin-name&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.foo&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;classname&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.foo.bar.MyTest&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;vmargs&quot; value=&quot;-Dbaz=true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</pre></code>

 <li><b>collect</b> - This
     target collects the XML files that are produced over the course of the
     test script. It takes two arguments: </li>
 <ul>
  <li><i>includes</i> - A
      pattern matching all XML files to be included in the test report. This
      argument is typically &quot;org*.xml&quot;</li>
  <li><i>output-file</i> -
      The filename where the output of the test gets stored. For the automated
      build process, this file should be ${pluginname}.xml, and be located in
      the ECLIPSE_HOME directory.</li>
 </ul>

<p>For example, the following code collects all of the files
matching the pattern &quot;org*.xml&quot; in the directory ${eclipse-home},
into the file named &quot;logfile.xml&quot;.

<code><pre>
&lt;ant target=&quot;collect&quot; antfile=&quot;${library-file}&quot; dir=&quot;${eclipse-home}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;includes&quot; value=&quot;org*.xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;output-file&quot; value=&quot;logfile.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</pre></code>

  <li><b>test-regressions</b> - This target takes two compound XML files (after 
    a collect - even if collect is only given 1 file), and produces a text file 
    that contains a list of all test status changes that occur between the two 
    files. It will report new tests added, old tests that weren't run, and tests 
    whose status changed (pass to fail, or fail to pass). This target takes three 
    arguments: </li>
 <ul>
  <li><i>oldfile</i> - the
      baseline file to compare against</li>
  <li><i>newfile</i> - the
      file containing the results of the most recent test run</li>
  <li><i>outfile</i> - the
      file in which to place the results of the regression test</li>
 </ul>

<p>For example, the following code compares the test runs that
were logged into the files &quot;old.xml&quot; and &quot;new.xml&quot;, and
creates a file called &quot;output.txt&quot; that holds the differences between
the two runs.

<code><pre>
&lt;ant target=&quot;test-regressions&quot; antfile=&quot;${library-file}&quot; dir=&quot;${eclipse-home}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;oldfile&quot; value=&quot;old.xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;newfile&quot; value=&quot;new.xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;outfile&quot; value=&quot;output.txt&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</pre></code>

 <li><b>notify</b> - This target
     sends email notification of the status of the latest test run. Typically,
     this sends the results of the latest regression test to a developer so
     that new test failures can be detected quickly. This target takes two
     parameters: </li>
 <ul>
  <li><i>infile</i> - the
      name of the file containing the message to send</li>
  <li><i>address</i> - the
      email address to send the file to</li>
 </ul>

<p>For example, the following code will mail the contents of
the file &quot;output.txt&quot; to the address &quot;foo@bar.com&quot;. 

<code><pre>
&lt;ant target=&quot;notify&quot; antfile=&quot;${library-file}&quot; dir=&quot;${eclipse-home}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;infile&quot; value=&quot;output.txt&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;address&quot; value=&quot;foo@bar.com&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/ant&gt;
</pre></code>
</ul>

<h2>Examples:</h2>

<p>Included is the 'test.xml' file from the org.eclipse.ui.tests plugin. This
file controls all of the automated testing that is done for the org.eclipse.ui
plugin. It can be run from inside of Eclipse or from the command line. It is
intended to serve as a template file for testing any other plugin.</p>

<p>Notice that the structure of the file roughly mirrors that of a JUnit test.
Targets are defined for setting up the tests, defining what needs to be done,
cleaning up after the tests, and running everything in the right order.</p>

<h2>Known Issues:</h2>

<h4>Problem 1: Issues with Ant 1.3</h4>

<p>Ant 1.3 has some issues when used with the &lt;style&gt; tag and absolute
paths. Also, any tests that use the <code>System.exit()</code> call will not
log their output properly when using Ant 1.3.</p>

<h4>Problem 2: ECLIPSE_HOME</h4>

<p>The test suites need to know where the root of the eclipse install is on the
file system (the ECLIPSE_HOME variable). However, this variable is only defined
in JDT. The ${eclipse-home} property can be set to a reasonable default inside
of the test.xml script. Then tests can be run from the standard Ant window,
without having to specify -Declipse-home=%ECLIPSE_HOME%. If a value for
${eclipse-home} does get passed in, the default (specified in test.xml) gets
overridden. The parameter is passed in by the build mechanism. For most cases,
the value &quot;${basedir}/../..&quot; is a reasonable default.</p>

<h4>Problem 3: Ugly reference to library.xml</h4>

<p>org.eclipse.test should provide Ant tasks, not template scripts.</p>

<h4>Problem 4: No console output</h4>

<p>When you run a TestSuite using the standard JUnit, it normally outputs a
series of dots to the console so that you can track the TestSuite's progress.
It is not possible to add this feature to the automated testing process at this
point in time.</p>

<h4>Problem 5: Ant java task on Linux</h4>

<p>Ant expects there to be a java executable on the system path. Furthermore, the executable
must be a real file, not a symbolic link. If the test framework is throwing an exception
<code>java.io.IOException: java: not found</code>, ensure that the java executable is on
your system path.</p>

<h4>Problem 6: PDE</h4>
<p>The testing framework currently has no knowledge of PDE. In order to run the automated
you must be running a self hosting environment with a full development and target Eclipse.</p>
