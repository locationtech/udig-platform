   		A new Map editor will be opened based on the contents of your shape file. The default name and projection of the Map has been taken from your shapefile.
<br/><br/>
You can see the Catalog view has been updated with an entry for the layer <b>countries.shp</b>. This view is used to track the use of resources by the uDig application.
<br/><br/>
The Layers view shows a single layer displayed on this map. This view is used to change the order and appearance of information in your Map.
<br/><br/>
The Projects view has been updated to show that your map is stored in projects. You can have multiple projects open at a time, each project can have several maps.
<br/><br/>
<b>Tip</b> You can also drag and drop shape files directly into the uDig application.
