<h2>Behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Merge Tool</em> operates upon the current Layer.</p>
<p>In &#8216;<strong>classic mode</strong>&#8216;, once the <em>Merge Tool</em> is selected, you can drag a bounding box to select which Features to merge.</p>
<p>In &#8216;<strong>operation mode</strong>&#8216; first selection is performed with Box Selection tool, then a Right-click (anywhere in the map) opens the context menu where <em class="menuselection">Operations ‣ Merge Selected</em> can be selected.</p>
<p>A view will be opened so you can specify exactly which attribute values from the input Features the <em>merged Feature</em> attributes shall assume the values of.</p>
<p>It could be the case that the <em>geometric union</em> produces a geometry whose type is not compatible
with the allowable geometry type declared at the <em>Layer</em>&#8216;s <em>FeatureType</em>. For example, merging two
non touching <em>Polygons</em> on a polygon <em>Layer</em> would produce a <em>MultiPolygon</em>. In this case, assigning
the geometric union to the merged <em>Feature</em> geometry attribute will not be possible, but one of the
geometries from the source <em>Features</em> could be set through the <em>Merge View</em>.</p>
<p>When the <em>Merge Tool</em> proceeds to create the new, merged Feature, the ones it comes from will be
deleted at the same time.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>Merge Tool</em> does not commit the result, but lets you undo the operation if desired,
or commit the changes to the backend data repository as you would normally do in uDig.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="_images/information.gif" />
</div>
<p><strong>Coordinate Reference System</strong></p>
<p>When the <em>Merge Tool</em> is instructed to create the new geometry as the union of the geometries from
the input <em>Features</em>, the union is performed in the current <em>Layer</em>&#8216;s <em>Coordinate Reference System</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="usage-example-classic-mode">
<h2>Usage Example (&#8216;<em>classic mode</em>&#8216;)<a class="headerlink" href="#usage-example-classic-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Select the <em>Merge Tool</em> from the drop down buttons list as shown in <em>Figure 1</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="_images/merge_1_select_tool.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1. Selecting the Merge Tool.</strong></p>
<p>Draw the <em>Bounding Box</em> to be used as the filter to select the <em>Feature</em> to be merged. At least two
<em>Features</em> need to be selected for doing a Merge, but the view will be opened if one feature is
selected.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="_images/merge_2_select_features.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2. Selecting the Features to merge.</strong></p>
<p>Once you release the mouse button, the <em>features</em> matching the bounding box will be looked up and
the <em>Merge View</em> will show up.
<em>Figure 3</em> shows the <em>Merge View</em>, which consists of two panels.
The panel at the left is the <em>Source Features</em> panel and presents the selected <em>features</em>, their
attributes, and allows to select attribute values from source features to assign to the <em>Merge
Feature</em>.</p>
<p>The panel, at the right, is called the <em>Merge Feature</em> panel and presents the attributes of the
<em>feature</em> to be created as the result of setting its attributes through the <em>Source Features</em>.</p>
<p>When the <em>Merge View</em> is opened, the <em>Merge Feature</em> panel is populated with the attributes from the
first <em>Source</em> feature found (the one at the top on the <em>Source Features</em> panel). The geometry
attribute of the <em>Merge Feature</em> assumes the value of the geometric union of the geometries from the
source Features, and if that is not possible due to a type conflict with the Layer&#8217;s <em>FeatureType</em>,
it assumes the value of the geometry from the first Feature.
<img alt="image4" src="_images/MergeDialog1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3. Merge View.</strong>
While the <em>Merge View</em> is opened, the user can set specific attributes in the <em>Merge Feature</em> to
assume the values from other <em>Source Features</em> than the one at the top, by activating the checkbox
corresponding to the desired attribute on the desired <em>Source Feature</em>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to select the whole set of attribute of a single <em>Source Feature</em> by activating
the checkbox corresponding to the desired <em>Source Feature</em>.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4</em> shows how two attributes, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SOVEREIGN</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">COLOR_MAP</span></tt> have been assigned to the
<em>Merge Feature</em> from another <em>Source Feature</em> than the default one.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="_images/MergeDialog2.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4. Merge View with user specified attributes.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, when you&#8217;re ready setting the geometric and non geometric attribute values for the <em>Merge
Feature</em>, press the <em>Finish</em> button on the <em>Merge View</em>.
The <em>Merge Tool</em> will create the new <em>Merge Feature</em> and delete the <em>Source Features</em> in a single,
undoable step.</p>
<p>The <em>Map</em> in <em>Figure 5</em> shows how the two buildings on this example have been merged into one, and
the <em>Table View</em> with the newly created <em>Feature</em>.</p>

For deleting features, select the feature to be deleted and click on the delete button or draw a
