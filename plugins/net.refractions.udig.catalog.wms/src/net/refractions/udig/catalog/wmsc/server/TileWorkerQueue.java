/**
 * This is a work queue for re-using a group of threads to do Tile work.  An example use
 * is the work of saving tiles to disk.  When preloading all tiles in a tileset, the number of
 * threads originally got out of hand for saving tiles.  This queue allows a group
 * of threads to be reused to do the work.  It can also be used to manage the threads
 * for sending tile requests out, but there should be a separate queue for each.
