<h2>Printing User Interface</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Provides a user-interface to the model and controller code in the
udig.printing.* plugins.</p>

<h3>TODO</h3>
<p>There is still a lot of work that needs to be done on the printing user
interface. </p>

<ul>
<li>Currently the PageEditor does not permit saving, because there is no
persistence system hooked up.
<li>The notion of the LabelBox needs to be abstracted more.
<li>It should be possible to create Map Boxes from the Palette.
<li>There needs to be the ability to add Boxes to a Page or delete them from a Page.
<li>Pages should be able to be resized (landscape, portrait, A4, etc.).
<li>MapBox should display an image instead of the map name
<li>The duplication of the map might be hard for user's to understand. (Selecting
Edit Map on the MapBox opens a different map from the original one that the Page
was created with. Need ideas here.
<li>LabelBox's text should be centered within the box.
<li>The font (style, colour, size) of the text in a LabelBox should be changeable.
<li>It should be possible to scroll to the bottom of the Page. Currently it is
not, unless there is a Box down there already.
<li>Printed WMS images should be higher DPI
</ul>
