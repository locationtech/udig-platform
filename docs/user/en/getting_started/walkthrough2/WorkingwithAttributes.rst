 * After making changes, hit the  :guilabel:`Apply` button to update the map, you can experiment with the settings and press
   :guilabel:`Close` when you are finished.

* Ensure that **Tasmania cities** is still selected in the layers view, and select the Table view.

* The first time you use table view you will need to accept a warning that all the features will be loaded into memory.

* Go ahead and rename the city after yourself. Change the CITY_NAME attribute and you can watch the map update.

  .. note::
     Not all aspects of a feature are editable. - bounds are derived from the geometry, and ID is dictated the WFS.


* Press the :guilabel:`Commit Changes` button, in the tool bar, to send your changes off to the Web Feature Server.
