Introduction
------------

In this workbook we are going to cover two major topics. The first is a tour of Web Feature Server
functionality using a local GeoServer installation. We will use a WFS to edit both feature geometry
and feature attributes. We will also show how to export information out of a WFS using both a local
shape file and the system clip board.

The rest of the workbook is devoted to working with information. We will create a new feature type
by hand, and work with a range of feature creation and editing tools. Finally we will save the
result to a new file.
