    :height: 10.22cm


* While an edit tool is **active** press :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`SHIFT` + :kbd:`S`. This will cycle through the available snap behaviors. 
  A small pop-up will display the new behavior.

* You can see a short cut of the tool snapping options in the tool options along the bottom of the map.
