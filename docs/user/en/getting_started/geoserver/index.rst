Introduction
------------

GeoServer is Java Enterprise Edition application used to publish spatial information. It supports a number of Industry Standard protocols and also offers a REST API for configuration.

In this workbook we are going to install GeoServer and go over a couple of configuration options.

After completing this workbook, you will have:

 * Installed a Java Runtime Environment onto your computer

 * Installed GeoServer using the Windows installer

 * Started up and Customize GeoServer

 * Started the Open Layers Tasmania Preview

Java Runtime Environment
------------------------

GeoServer is a Java application – if you do not already have Java on your system please go ahead and install it now. Any version of Java 5 or newer will do fine.

  * Download the latest Java SE Runtime Environment from oracle:

  At the time of writing jre_7u1-windows-i586.exe had just been released.

  * Double-click the installer (jre_7u1-windows-i586.exe is used in this example) and accept the license agreement.

  * GeoServer will open up a console running the Jetty Application Server; please wait until
    Jetty indicates it is listening on port 8080 as shown below.

  .. note::
     If you already jave a web server running on 8080 you can modify the jetty xml file by hand.

What to do Next
---------------

If you finish early here are some challenges.

  * The “Sample Requests” demo lets you try out requests one at a time by selecting them from a List 
    and hitting Submit.
  
    * Try out a GetFeature request by hand.
  
    * Try out WMS GetCapabilities and confirm the title is as you defined it.

  * Turn down the amount of logging to let GeoServer run faster

  * Advanced: Have a look at the *open layers* link for the Tasmania layer preview. Can you explain
    what trick Geoserver is doing.
  
  .. hint:: 
     Look at the URL and source code of the Tasmania layer preview.


  * How can you use GeoServer in your organisation?
