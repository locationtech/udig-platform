Map selection may also be defined using the :doc:`Table view`.

Box Selection
-------------

The box selection tool can be used to:

-  Draw a box around content that you wish selected
-  Click on individual features

AOI Selection
-------------

The Area of Interest tool allows you to interactively define the area of interest. The tool works
with background layers that have been marked as suitable for use as an area of interest.

The tool works by:

-  Click to select an area of interest (starting from no area of interest, you can click to drill
   down through the area of interest layers for greater and greater detail)
-  Right click to move back from the current area of interest (you can click repeatedly to move back
   up until no area of interest is defined)
-  You can drag to select several features as the area of interest
