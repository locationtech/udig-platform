Layers view
###########

The Layers view shows the layers displayed on the current Map.

The context menu for this view also allows you to change the style of the selected layer, perform
analysis on the layer, zoom to the layer, delete the layer, rename the layer and set which tools
will work on the layer (Tool Applicability).

Here is what the Layers view looks like:

Like other views in the Workbench, the Layers has its own toolbar. Toolbar buttons are provided for
moving a layer up or down in the rendering context.

This command brings the selected layer towards the front, changing its z order, allowing it to
