How you can Help
----------------

Some of these plugins are nifity and down right useful; what they lack is:

-  testing - try out these plugins, give me feedback (even if they work!). Unless we put the time in
   to test and have confidence in these plugins they will remain as experiments.
-  polish - we need to make sure the workflow is friendly and the icons make sense and all the usual
   care and attention required for integration with the uDig application
-  time (or funding) - if you can help out with feedback that would be great, if you can help out
   with funds (perhaps you need a north arrow for your application?) that would be good too. If you
   can help out with patches that would be wonderful
-  documentation
