Web Map Server Style Pages
##########################

Web Map Servers allow a little bit of control over how content is drawn. The :doc:`Style Editor dialog` 
makes use of the following pages when working with a WMS Layer.

* `Simple`_

* `WMS Named Style`_

The pages displayed depend on the configuration of the web map service you are using.

Simple
======

You can change a few simple settings on a WMS Layer. These settings control how the WMS Layer is
intergrated into your Map.

Raster
~~~~~~

You can change the opacity of the resulting WMS Layer. The default value is 100%.

Min Scale
~~~~~~~~~

You can define the minimum scale for which this layer should be displayed. This is useful when
shutting off layers that become pixelated when you zoom too close.

Max Scale
~~~~~~~~~

You can define the maximum scale for which this layer is displayed.

This is useful when working with a WMS Server which is slow when looking at too much content.

WMS Named Style
===============

Web Map Servers sometimes publish a list of alternate stylee
