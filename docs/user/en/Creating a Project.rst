Creating a Project
==================

Here are some instructions for creating a simple project. New projects and maps can be created using
several different approaches. In this section spatial information will be manipulated using three
different approaches:

* :doc:`File Menu`

* :doc:`New Button <Using new to add a Map to a Project>`

* :doc:`Context Menu <Using the Context menu to add a Map to a Project>`


A project can be created using the **File** menu. Once the project has been created a Map can be
created as well. There are more ways to locate information then are listed here, we are simply
introducing you to the several user interface conventions.
