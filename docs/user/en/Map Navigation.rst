Map Navigation
##############

There are many options for navigation using a Map. The navigation tools (Zoom and Pan) are located
in the tool palette. You will also find quick zoom in and zoom out tools in the toolbar and the
ability to go backward and forward in navigation history.

Navigation also covers the concept of changing your Map projection. Some datasets also support the
idea of changing the time or elevation displayed.
