Available Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fill Vertex Handles - Indicates whether the vertex handles should be filled. This can greatly
   slow down drawing of the edit feature and adversely affect the user interaction during editing
   when editing geometries with many vertices.

   Default is off.

-  Fill Selected Polygons - Indicates whether polygons will be filled. It is an attractive effect
   but can be problematic when the selected polygon takes up most of the display.

   Default is off.
