Creating fast views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fast views are hidden views, which can quickly be made visible. These instructions explain how to
create a fast view from the Projects view, and then explain how to use the view once it is a fast
view.

There are two ways to create a fast view:

-  Using drag and drop.
-  Using a menu operation available from the View System menu.

Create a fast view using drag and drop as follows.

#. In the Projects view click on the title bar and drag it to the shortcut bar at the bottom left of
   the window.
#. Once over the shortcut bar, the cursor will change to a "fast view" cursor. Release the mouse
   button to drop the Projects view onto the shortcut bar.

The shortcut bar now includes a button for the Projects fast view:

To create a fast view using the second approach, start by popping up the context menu over the
Projects view's tab. From this menu, select Fast View.
