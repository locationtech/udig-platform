Projects contain:

* :doc:`Page`


You can create a default map as outlined in Getting Started Documentation, or create a Map from a
Data Source as described in Local Registry Documentation.

The Layers in Maps can be browsed and the context menu can be used to perform operations and inspect
the layers and maps.
