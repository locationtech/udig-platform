Please note that many support views are designed to facilitate the use of the Map Editor; often
making use of it for display and interaction.

Tools
-----

Interaction with the Map Editor is defined by the current tool being used. Tools are primary found
in the tool palette on the right of the map, although custom tools for specific needs can be found
in the appropriate view.

You can hide and show the tool palette by clicking the small arrow on the top right of the palette
(|image0|) and (|image1|). This can be useful if you need more room to view your map and have little
need for the tools.

The selected tool will be displayed with a highlighted background as in the image below

To find different tools click the draw corresponding to the tool set you wish to use, each draw will
contain different contextual tools, for instance the Pan Tools draw has tools for panning around the
map and the Editing draw has tools specifically for editing features.

Tools are arranged into the following categories:

   Information Tools
   Navigation Tools
   Selection Tools
