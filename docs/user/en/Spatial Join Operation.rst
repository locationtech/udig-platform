Spatial Join Operation
######################

Creates a new layer containing the features from the second layer that match the indicated spatial
relation., following this standard:

*First Layer* **Relation** *Second Layer*

The colour convention used to represent the different layers are:

 The different Spatial Join Geom operations are:

Contains
--------

Features in the *Second Layer* lie in the interior of features of the *First Layer* (the inverse of
Within). *Example:*

|image1|

Crosses
--------

The Features share some but not all interior points, and the dimension of the intersection is less
than that of at least one of the Features. *Example:*

|image2|

Disjoint
--------

The Features have no point in common. *Example:*

|image3|

Equals
--------

The Features are topologically equal and are overlapped making them match exactly. *Example:*

|image4|

Intersects
----------

The Features have at least one point in common (the inverse of Disjoint). *Example:*

|image5|

Overlaps
--------

The Features share some but not all points in common, and the intersection has the same dimension
as the Features themselves. *Example:*

|image6|

Touches
--------

The Features have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points. *Example:*

|image7|

Within
--------

Features in the *First Layer* lie in the interior of the Features in the *Second Layer*. *Example:*

|image8|

Sample Usage
------------

Go to the *Spatial Operations View*, and select *Join Geom* from the *Operation* drop down.
The *Join Geom* operation's specific input options will show up.

#. **Select the** ***First Source Layer***\ **:** On the *First Layer* drop down, select the first
   *Layer* you want to Join. By default, the currently selected *Layer* in the *Layers View* will be
   chosen for you.
#. **Select the** ***Relation***\ **:** On the *Relation* drop down, select the *Relation* to be
   used to Join the two layers.
#. **Select the** ***Second Source Layer***\ **:** On the *Second Layer* drop down, select the
   second *Layer* you want to Join. By default, none will be selected.
#. **Select the** ***Result Layer***\ **:** On the *Result Layer* box, select the name of the
   *Layer* you want to create containing the Spatial Join Operation Result. You will be proposed a
   default name for that *Layer*.
#. **Perform the operation:** Now you're ready to go. Press the *Perform* button from the View's
   tool bar and the operation will begin.
