Installation and Configuration
##############################

The main uDig application is a cross platform application (available on windows, linux and mac osx).
You can install additional functionality (from update sites) after your initial set up and
configuration.

The uDig application itself consists of a "workbench window". You can configure the arrangement of
this display by rearranging the views and editors displayed.
