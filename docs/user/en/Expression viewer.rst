Expression viewer
#################

Expression viewers are used in :doc:`Style Editor dialog` and :doc:`Transform dialog` when a formula is used to calculate a value on a feature by
feature basis.

This is a powerful technique that can be used for on the fly styling, or directly for data
processing.

You can switch between appropriate options using the drop down arrow on the right hand side.
Depending on what the expression is for, and what kind of information you are working with,
different options will be listed some of which are described below:

* `Constraint Query Language`_

* `Builder`_

* `RGB Color`_

* `Numbers`_


When defining an expression you can make use of the full range of :doc:`Constraint Query Language` functions.

-  To concatenate several values into a single text output:

   ::

       Concatenate( NAME, ' ', CITY_CODE, ' Zone ', ZONE)

-  To smoothly interpolate between a min and a max value (used here to write out LEVEL as a
   percentage):

   ::

       Concatenate( Interpolate( LEVEL, 42, 0, 3046, 100, "linear"), "%" )
