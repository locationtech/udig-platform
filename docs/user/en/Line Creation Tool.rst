~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Line Creation Tool allows lines created. To create a line simply select a line layer in the
:doc:`Layers view` and click to begin a new line.

Vertex Snapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default :doc:`snapping <Snapping>` is turned off however, if desired :doc:`snapping <Snapping>`
can be used during geometry creation.

-  Line creation with snapping to the current layer. Notice that it didn't snap to the municipality
   which is in another layer (circled in red)

   |image1|

-  Line creation with snapping to the all layers. With this snapping it has snapped to the features
   on other layers.

-  Line creation with snapping to the grid. The grid is only seen when the grid map graphic is on.
   **Layer > Grid**

Advanced Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Line Creation Tool also has an advanced mode that provides all the functionality that the :doc:`Edit Geometry Tool`
has, except that only lines can be edited. A summary of the advanced editing features are:

-  Clicking an existing line will select it.
-  An existing line can be extended by

#. Clicking on a line to select it

   |image4|

#. Click on an end point to start extending the line

   |image5|

-  Vertices in selected lines can be moved.
-  Vertices in selected lines can be added or deleted
-  Holding :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`SHIFT` down will allow the entire geometry to be moved.
-  As with the :doc:`Edit Geometry Tool` the vertex operations can be
   performed on multiple vertices at once if many vertices are selected.
