Toolbars
--------

There are *three* kinds of toolbars in the Workbench.

#. The Main Toolbar (or Workbench toolbar)

   Displayed at the top of the Workbench window directly beneath the menu bar. Items in the toolbar
   might be enabled or disabled based on the state of either the active view or editor. You can
   rearange sections of the main toolbar using the mouse.
   
#. Individual View Toolbars

   These appear in the title bar of a view. Actions in a view's toolbar apply only to the view in
   which they appear. Some view toolbars include a Menu button, shown as an inverted triangle, that
   contain additional actions for that view.
   
#. The fast view bar

   A toolbar that contains icons representing the current set of fast views. A fast view is a
   shortcut to a view that is frequently used; see the section on fast views for more information.
   The fast view bar appears in the bottom left corner of the workbench by default. However, it is
   possible to position it on the left or right as well.
