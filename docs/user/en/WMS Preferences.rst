Available Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Image order - Not all Web Map Servers provide all image types as output images. The image order
   sets the order in which the image types are prioritized. For example png is usually preferred
   over jpg because it has an alpha channel so layers below the wms layer can be seen through a png
   (in transparent locations) but not through a jpg.
   However, on the macintosh certain png images can not be decoded so gif is often preferred over a
   png images on macintosh computers.
   As stated this is an advanced option so do not modify it unless you understand the image formats
   and the ramifications of using one image type over another.
