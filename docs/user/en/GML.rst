GML
~~~

An XML document containing spatial data. Often these documents are captured on disk as a file with
the extension ".gml".

Please be aware that a "gml" file is actually a normal XML document; it just happens to be a
document is based on the "abstract" Geographic Markup Language specifications.

GML Files
^^^^^^^^^

GML files in udig can currently only be supported if they meet two very strict restrictions:

-  filename.xsd - an xml schema document defining the "data product" being loaded
-  filename.gml - an xml document defined against the schema provided above

We only support GML2 based schemas with simple content at this time. There is improved GML support
for WFS 1.1 access; this has not been packaged for offline use at this time.

Geography Markup Language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most markup language specifications are published with the idea of defining a document format that
applications can use to share information. I am afraid that "GML" handles things a little bit
differently - it provides an XML Schema that can be used as a starting point when an organization
defines a data product.

As such we really do need access to the description of the data product in order to open up a "gml
document".

this time)
