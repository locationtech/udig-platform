Accessing context sensitive help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access the context-sensitive help for a given widget select the widget by putting focus on it
(see the table below). then press F1 key. On GTK windowing system use Ctrl+F1, and on Carbon 
windowing system use Help key
instead of F1.
This displays an infopop with the description of the selected widget, and usually, a list of links
to related information. You can dismiss the infopop by clicking outside it, or by pressing Esc.

If you want more information than what is shown in the infopop, click a link to the related
information. This opens the Help browser to the selected topic and closes the infopop. The list of
related links stays in the left hand frame, so you do not have to press F1 again if you are
interested in other topics related to the same widget.

To access context sensitive help for a widget, you must put focus on it and then press F1. The
following table shows how to put focus on some of the different kinds of widgets.
