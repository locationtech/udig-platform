Using Vertex Tools
##################

Vertex tools are tools that modify the shape of existing geometries by adding/removing or deleting
vertices from geometries. The partial exception is the hole cutting tool, which can create and edit
holes in polygons.

The following tools feature vertex editing:

:doc:`Edit Geometry Tool`

 :doc:`Add Vertex Tool`

 :doc:`Remove Vertex Tool`

 :doc:`Hole Cutter`


:doc:`Polygon Creation Tool`

 :doc:`Line Creation Tool`

 :doc:`Point Creation Tool`

 :doc:`Draw Geometry Tool`

 :doc:`Rectangle Tool`

 :doc:`Ellipse Tool`


:doc:`Fill Tool`

 :doc:`Split Tool`

 :doc:`Delete Tool`


Notes on working with vertex tools:

-  Vertexes are represented by a small square, which can be selected with a single click. Depending
   on how zoomed out you are a single vertex may represent many points in your original dataset.
-  The vertex will change shape during editing, as an example when creating a polygon the original
   starting point will grow larger as you close the polygon to provide feedback that snapping will
   be performed.
-  When editing animated circles are used to indicate any snapping that occurs; this provides a
   visual indicate of where you clicked and where the vertex was relocated to due to snapping
-  When deleting a vertex visual feedback is also provided
-  If any additional feedback is required it will be offered in the middle of your map as a "pop up
   bubble" allowing you to fix the problem without losing your place.
-  many of the tools support the use of the scroll wheel to change zoom level while editing; and the
   middle mouse button to support panning
