Standard CRS
============

This tab allows you to explore the standard coordiante reference systems listed by:

-  EPSG codes
-  OGC codes

These codes are used to look up an exhaustive formal definition of a coordinate reference system. By
describing your data in this manner uDig can both work faster and with greater accuracy.

Custom CRS
----------

You can supply your own custom coordinate reference system using the "Well Known Text" format.

.. note::
   You can switch to this tab to review a "Standard CRS\* definition using WKT as a quick 
   informal summary; or as a starting point for your own custom definition.
