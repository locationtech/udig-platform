To review the uDig application log file in notepad (or your favourite text editor).

#. Choose :menuselection:`Help --> About uDig` from the menu bar
#. Press the **Configuration Details** button, this screen shows all kinds of platform specific
   information
#. Press the **View Error Log** button
#. Choose the program you want to use to open the file from the list, I usually use **Notepad** when
   on windows
