Layer
~~~~~

Information displayed on a map is drawn as a series of Layers. Each layer renders information from a
specific dataset, making use of a :doc:`Style` contributing to the final rendered map.

Layers are organised according to the order they are drawn. With one layer drawn over top of another
resulting in the final image. Care should be taken in organising Layers so that critical information
is not unintentionally hidden from view.

Examples:

-  A shapefile of roads, combined with a Style illustrating road type, would drawn onto the Map as a
   Layer.
