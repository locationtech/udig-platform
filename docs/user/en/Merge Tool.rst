Merge Tool
----------

|image0| Merges geometries and attributes from various Features.

The *Merge Tool* works by selecting a set of features to be merged into one. It allows to set the
geometry and attributes of the merged Feature. The geometry could be either the **geometric union**
of the geometries from the input features, or the single geometry from one of the input features.

.. note:: Two different approaches to Merge Tool usage are currently available: the **classic mode** and the new **operation mode**. Their desciption in noted to follow.

To use the Merge tool ('*classic mode*'):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Select the **Merge Tool** from the feature tool category in the tool bar.
    You can use the keyboard short cut **F** to cycle through the available feature tools
#. Draw a box covering one or more features
#. The **Merge Feature** view will appear display two columns:

   -  Sources: these are the features that are being combined; check off the attributes you wish to
      appear in the result
   -  Merge Feature: this is the resulting Geometry

#. For doing a Merge you will need 2 or more features.
#. You can continue selecting more features by drawing a box.
#. Press **Finish** (|image14|) to perform the operation
#. You can inspect your work in the `Map editor <Map%20editor.html>`_
#. To save your work please press **Edit > Commit** from the menu bar

|image1|

To use the Merge tool ('*operation mode*'):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Using the **Box Selection tool**, draw a box covering one or more features.
#. **Right-click anywhere** in the map and select :menuselection:`Operations --> Merge Selected`
#. The **Merge Feature** view will appear containing two columns:

   -  Sources: these are the features that are being combined; check off the attributes you wish to appear in the result
   -  Merge Feature: this is the resulting Geometry

#. For doing a Merge you will need 2 or more features in your featureset.
#. Featureset can be changed using the **Box Selection tool**

   -  Shift + Left-Click on a new feature in the map to **ADD** it to the current featureset;
   -  Ctrl + Left-Click on a selected feature to **REMOVE** it from current set;
   -  ..or just draw a new box over some other features to replace the whole tool content.

#. Press **Finish** (|image14|) to perform the actual merge operation
#. You can inspect your work in the `Map editor <Map%20editor.html>`_
#. To **save** your work please press :menuselection:`Edit --> Commit` from the menu bar



Behavior
~~~~~~~~

The *Merge Tool* operates upon the current Layer.

In '**classic mode**', once the *Merge Tool* is selected, you can drag a bounding box to select which Features to merge.

In '**operation mode**' first selection is performed with Box Selection tool, then a Right-click (anywhere in the map) opens the context menu where :menuselection:`Operations --> Merge Selected` can be selected.

A view will be opened so you can specify exactly which attribute values from the input Features the *merged Feature* attributes shall assume the values of.

It could be the case that the *geometric union* produces a geometry whose type is not compatible
with the allowable geometry type declared at the *Layer*'s *FeatureType*. For example, merging two
non touching *Polygons* on a polygon *Layer* would produce a *MultiPolygon*. In this case, assigning
the geometric union to the merged *Feature* geometry attribute will not be possible, but one of the
geometries from the source *Features* could be set through the *Merge View*.

When the *Merge Tool* proceeds to create the new, merged Feature, the ones it comes from will be
deleted at the same time.

Note that the *Merge Tool* does not commit the result, but lets you undo the operation if desired,
or commit the changes to the backend data repository as you would normally do in uDig.

**Coordinate Reference System**

When the *Merge Tool* is instructed to create the new geometry as the union of the geometries from
the input *Features*, the union is performed in the current *Layer*'s *Coordinate Reference System*.

Usage Example ('*classic mode*')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the *Merge Tool* from the drop down buttons list as shown in *Figure 1*.

|image2|

**Figure 1. Selecting the Merge Tool.**

Draw the *Bounding Box* to be used as the filter to select the *Feature* to be merged. At least two
*Features* need to be selected for doing a Merge, but the view will be opened if one feature is
selected.

|image3|

**Figure 2. Selecting the Features to merge.**

Once you release the mouse button, the *features* matching the bounding box will be looked up and
the *Merge View* will show up.
*Figure 3* shows the *Merge View*, which consists of two panels.
The panel at the left is the *Source Features* panel and presents the selected *features*, their
attributes, and allows to select attribute values from source features to assign to the *Merge
Feature*.

The panel, at the right, is called the *Merge Feature* panel and presents the attributes of the
*feature* to be created as the result of setting its attributes through the *Source Features*.

When the *Merge View* is opened, the *Merge Feature* panel is populated with the attributes from the
first *Source* feature found (the one at the top on the *Source Features* panel). The geometry
attribute of the *Merge Feature* assumes the value of the geometric union of the geometries from the
source Features, and if that is not possible due to a type conflict with the Layer's *FeatureType*,
it assumes the value of the geometry from the first Feature.
|image4|

**Figure 3. Merge View.**
While the *Merge View* is opened, the user can set specific attributes in the *Merge Feature* to
assume the values from other *Source Features* than the one at the top, by activating the checkbox
corresponding to the desired attribute on the desired *Source Feature*.

It is also possible to select the whole set of attribute of a single *Source Feature* by activating
the checkbox corresponding to the desired *Source Feature*.

*Figure 4* shows how two attributes, ``SOVEREIGN`` and ``COLOR_MAP`` have been assigned to the
*Merge Feature* from another *Source Feature* than the default one.

|image5|

**Figure 4. Merge View with user specified attributes.**

Finally, when you're ready setting the geometric and non geometric attribute values for the *Merge
Feature*, press the *Finish* button on the *Merge View*.
The *Merge Tool* will create the new *Merge Feature* and delete the *Source Features* in a single,
undoable step.

The *Map* in *Figure 5* shows how the two buildings on this example have been merged into one, and
the *Table View* with the newly created *Feature*.

**Figure 5. Merge result**

Adding and deleting features.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For adding more features to be merged, select those features drawing a bounding box and they will be
added to the view.
For deleting features, select the feature to be deleted and click on the delete button or draw a
bounding box with Ctrl key pushed over the desired feature.

Usage Example ('*operation mode*')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the *Box Selection Tool* to select features as in *Figure 7*.


|image8|

**Figure 7. Selecting features with the Box Selection Tool.**


Once the desired features are selected, right-click on them and select: :menuselection:`Operations --> Merge Selected`.


|image9|

**Figure 8. Launch the Operation -> Merge Selected command.**


The Merge View will be opened and selected features filled in.


|image10|

**Figure 9. The new Merge View windows containing the selected features.**


Selection can be changed with Box Selection tool and Merge View will adapt to changes.


|image11|

**Figure 10. A new selection is being created.**


|image12|

**Figure 11. Merge View self-updates and displays the new featureset.**


Merge Operation can be fine tuned and lauched as in  '*classic mode*'.
