Location View
#############

The location view is used as a front end to geocoder services, allowing you to type in the address
and find a location.

The location view is not included in the default persepective, you will need to use 
:menuselection:`Windows --> Show View --> Location` to open this view.

The format used in the address bar is rather strict at this time.
