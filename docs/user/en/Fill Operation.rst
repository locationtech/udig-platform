Fill Operation
##############

Creates a new features using the boundary of polygons and the provided LineStrings

The *Fill Operation* takes the features from the *Source layer* and uses the LineString features
from the *second layer* to fill them.

The result of the *Fill Operation* could be stored on a new layer, on an existent layer or on the
previously used source layer.

Sample Usage
------------

On this example we are going to do a fill operation with the polygon layer edificios.shp and the
lineString layer carre1.shp and the resultant features will be added to the edificios.shp layer.

   **Figure 1. Before operation.**

Go to the *Spatial Operations* View, and select *Fill* from the *Operations list*.
The *Fill Operation*'s specific input options will show up.

Now is time to indicate the operation's inputs, as shown in *Figure 2*:

-  **Select the Source**
   Select the desired Polygon or MultiPolygon layer to use as border.

-  **Select the Using**
   Select the LineString or MultiLineString layer that will fill the new created polygon.

-  **Select the Result**
   At the *Result Layer* drop down, a tentative Layer name will be proposed for the layer the
   operation will create. You can change the name or select an existing Layer where to store the
   results. This combo will only load existent Polygon or MultiPolygon layer.

      **Figure 2. Define input and target layers.**

-  **Perform the operation**
   Once the input and target layers are defined, press the *Perform* button at the *Spatial
   Operations* View tool bar. The operation will begin processing and its progress will be shown up
   on a progress dialog, as shown in *Figure 3*. The operation may take a while to complete,
   depending on the amount and complexity of the input geometries.

Shows the newly created Layer (Fill\_1) added to the map, with the Features resulting of applying
the Fill operation between the *Source layer* and the *Second layer*.
