Closing an editor
=================

Now that we have an editor opened, here's how to close it.

#. To close any currently opened editor choose one of the following options:

   -  Press the close 'X' button: |image0| in the tab of the editor
   -  Select :menuselection:`File --> Close` from the menubar

#. Note the prompt to save the Map before the editor is closed
#. Click OK to save any changes and close the editor

If the editor was closed using :menuselection:`File --> Close`, notice that the option 
:menuselection:`File --> Close All` was also displayed. This is a quick way to close all 
of the open editors. If :menuselection:`File --> Close All` is chosen, a prompt will 
appear to choose which editors with unsaved changes should be saved.
