Closing an editor
=================

Now that we have an editor opened, here's how to close it.

#. To close any currently opened editor choose one of the following options:

   -  Press the close 'X' button: |image0| in the tab of the editor
   -  Select **File > Close** from the menubar

#. Note the prompt to save the Map before the editor is closed
#. Click OK to save any changes and close the editor

If the editor was closed using **File > Close**, notice that the option **File > Close All** was
also displayed. This is a quick way to close all of the open editors. If **File > Close All** is
chosen, a prompt will appear to choose which editors with unsaved changes should be saved.
