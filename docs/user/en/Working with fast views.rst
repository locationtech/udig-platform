Working with fast views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Projects view has now been converted into a fast view. This section will demonstrate what can
now be done with it.

#. Confirm that the shortcut bar at the bottom left of the window still has the Projects view and
   looks like this:

#. In the shortcut bar click on the Projects fast view button.
#. Observe that the Projects view slides out from the left side of the window.

#. The Projects fast view can be used as it would be normally. To resize a fast view, move the mouse
   to the right edge of the fast view where the cursor will change to a double-headed arrow. Then
   hold the left mouse button down as the mouse is moved.
#. To hide the fast view simply click on another view or editor or click on the Minimize button on
   the fast view's toolbar.

.. note::
   If a map or page is opened from the Projects fast view, the fast view will
   automatically hide itself to allow the file to be worked with.

To convert a fast view back to a regular view either:

#. Choose Fast View from the context menu of the icon in the top left corner of the view.
#. Drag the fast view icon from the tool bar, and drop it somewhere in the Workbench window.
