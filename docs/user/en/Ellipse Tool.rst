The ellipse tool is one of the simplest tools. To use it simply drag the mouse, drawing a ellipse
and release when the ellipse is the desired size. When the mouse is released a new feature is
created with ellipse as its geometry.

**Note:** Ellipses can be either polygon or lines.
 **Note:** There are no advanced editing features for the Ellipse Tool.
