Legend View
###########

The Legend view shows the layers displayed on the current Map. It also allows you to categorize the
layers by grouping them in folders.

The context menu for this view also allows you to add a new folder, change the style of the selected
layer, zoom to the layer, copy/paste layer, delete the layer, rename the layer, do operations to the
layer, export the layer and view layer properties.

Here is what the Legend view looks like:

 Like other views in the Workbench, the Legend view has its own toolbar. Toolbar buttons are
provided to add a new folder, move layers up or down the rendering hierarchy, toggle map graphics
and/or background layers' visibility in the view, toggle grid's visibility on the map, change the
style of the selected layer, turn on/off the mylar effect and zoom to the layer.
