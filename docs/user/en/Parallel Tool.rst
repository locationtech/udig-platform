Parallel Tool
#############

|image0| Creates a parallel LineString.

The *Parallel Tool* works by selecting a reference line and setting the distance, then will draw a
parallel line. The distance will be set when a click on the map is done. After that it calculates
the distance between this point and the nearest segment of the reference line.

How to use the Parallel tool:
-----------------------------

#. Select the **Parallel Tool** from the feature tool category in the tool bar.
    You can use the keyboard short cut **C** to cycle through the available feature tools
#. Select a reference line.
#. Set the distance by clicking on the map near the line.
    Doing this also set if the parallel line will be draw outside the feature or inside.
#. Once a preview is drawn, the distance can be changed using the view, and also if the parallel
   goes inside the feature or outside them.
