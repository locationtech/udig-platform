Zoom Tool
~~~~~~~~~

The Zoom tool allows the user to zoom towards or away from the map.
 The Zoom tool provides the following options:

-  If the left mouse button is clicked then the zoom is towards the map. The point clicked is the
   new center of the display after the zoom.
-  If the right mouse button is clicked then the zoom is away from the map. The point clicked is the
   new center of the display after the zoom.
-  If the left mouse button is dragged to form a box then the box indicates the new area that will
   be displayed on the screen (a zoom in).
-  If the right mouse button is dragged to form a box then the area on the screen during the drag
   will be fit into the box (a zoom out).
-  Rotating the mouse wheel will zoom towards or away from the map, keeping the center of the
   display the same.

An alternative to using the mouse wheel is holding alt- and moving the mouse left or right.
