Style
#####

Style is used to control the visual result when rendering data onto a Map. Style is most commonly
associated with :doc:`Style Layer Descriptor` files used to control
the drawing of features.

Individual Decorators define their own custom Style settings; for example to control the rendering
and appearance of grid or scale bar.
