Legend
######

A :doc:`Map` legend is a quick visual guide to understand the image of the map. As such it
needs to explain the information being presented; the use of colour on the map, and any symbols or
icons used.

In cartographic terms the Legend is used to describe the map (i.e. "Map Menu") and as a summary of
the colours and icons used (i.e. "symbology").

Map Definition (Map menu)
-------------------------

A legend is used to quickly allow the user to identify visually they layers of information shown on
the screen.

If the layers are communicating several types of information; they legend may group these together.

Note that not all map layers are required to be listed in the legend: Often background layers are
omitted to allow the user to focus on the key information being displayed.

Other common Map menu items include:

-  Map Title: Describing the region or purpose of the Map

Colour and Icons Used (Symbology)
---------------------------------

For Layers that produce complex symbology further detail to explain the symbols will be needed:

-  Continuous: When theming on a continuous value such as **height** often a smooth gradient of
   colour is used

-  Categorisation: When categorising information into groups the groups will need to be listed and
   provided a unique colour and appearance

-  Symbol Definition: When using distinct icons (or glyphs) to represent data points each shape will
   need to be listed along with a definition of what the symbol means.
   This can be relaxed when using a standard or well under known symbology set such as provided by
   MIL2525b or Emergency Response symbols for which the operator has been trainined.
