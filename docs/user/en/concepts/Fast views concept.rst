Fast Views
----------

Fast views are hidden views that can be quickly opened and closed. They work like other views except
they do not take up space in your Workbench window.

Fast views are represented by toolbar buttons on the *fast view bar*, which is the horizontal
toolbar on the bottom left of the Workbench window. When you click the toolbar button for a fast
view, that view opens temporarily in the current perspective. As soon as you click outside that
view, it is hidden again.

You can create a new fast view by:

-  dragging any open view to the shortcut bar; or
-  selecting **Fast View** from the menu on the view's title bar.
