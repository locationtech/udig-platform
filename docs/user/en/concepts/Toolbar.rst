Toolbar
-------

There are three kinds of toolbars in this application.

The **main toolbar**, sometimes called the Workbench toolbar, is displayed at the top of the
Workbench window directly beneath the menu bar. The contents of this toolbar change based on the
active perspective. Items in the toolbar might be enabled or disabled based on the state of either
the active view or editor. Sections of the main toolbar can be rearranged using the mouse.

There are also **individual view toolbars**, which appear in the title bar of a view. Actions in a
view's toolbar apply only to the view in which they appear. Some view toolbars include a Menu
button, shown as an inverted triangle, that contain actions for that view.

Finally, the **fast view bar** is toolbar that contains icons representing the current set of fast
views. A fast view is a shortcut to a view that is frequently used; see the section on fast views
for more information. The fast view bar appears in the bottom left corner of the workbench by
default. However, it is possible to position it on the left or right as well.

In all cases, you can find out what toolbar buttons do by moving your mouse pointer over the button
and reading the tooltip that opens. See the list of related reference topics below for a table of
all toolbar buttons.
