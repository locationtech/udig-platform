The Search view is used to search for resources. The exciting part is that the search view is able
to search catalogs on the web, allowing you to discover new information.

You can enter text into the text bar to search data with the key words. The checkbox to the right
will limit the search to items within the current map.
 Below the text area is are two areas. The left area shows the results of the search and dragging
items into the :doc:`Map editor` or the :doc:`Layers view` will
create a new layer from the dragged data. Right clicking on the data will allow some introspection
of the data as well as options to add to the current map or create a new map.
 The right area shows a summary of the data selected in the left.
