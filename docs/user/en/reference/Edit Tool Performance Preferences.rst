Available Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fill Selected Polygons - Indicates whether polygons will be filled. It is an attractive effect
   but can be problematic when the selected polygon takes up most of the display.

   Default is on.

-  Hide Features On Select - Indicates to hide selected Feature of the Layer. The feature is filtered 
   during rendering and therefore only the selection is rendered. It depends on the amount of data in 
   feature store and implementation for filtering using indices how performant it works. This can be 
   quite expensive

   Default is on.
