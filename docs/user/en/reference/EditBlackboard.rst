EditBlackboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EditBlackboard is a construct that represents the features that
are selected for editing. Using the selection tools features can be
added to the blackboard.


+ Clicking on a *non-selected* feature will clear the blackboard and
  add the feature to the edit blackboard.
+ SHIFT+click will add feaures to the EditBlackboard.
+ CTRL+click will add a *non-selected* feature to the EditBlackboard
  and will remove a *selected* feature from the EditBlackboard.


There are a few benefits to adding features to the EditBlackboard.


#. Switching between features on the EditBlackboard is much faster
   than switching between non-selected features. Partly because the
   system doesn't have to communicate with the service and partly because
   changes made aren't applied to the features.
#. Vertices that are shared between features can be moved as one as if
   there is a coverage model. There isn't but the editing can almost
   behave as if there is.
#. There is a snapping mode that only searches the EditBlackboard.
   This allows the user to choose what features can be snapped to as well
   as making snapping much faster (the *real* data doesn't have to be
   searched).
