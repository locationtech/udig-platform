Fast Views
----------

Fast views are hidden views that can be quickly opened and closed.
They work like other views except they do not take up space in your
Workbench window.

Fast views are represented by toolbar buttons on the *fast view bar*,
which is the horizontal toolbar on the bottom left of the Workbench
window. When you click the toolbar button for a fast view, that view
opens temporarily in the current perspective. As soon as you click
outside that view, it is hidden again.

You can create a new fast view by:


+ dragging any open view to the shortcut bar; or
+ selecting **Fast View** from the menu on the view's title bar.
