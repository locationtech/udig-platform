layer if it has been loaded with the incorrect projection.





Standard CRS
============

This tab allows you to explore the standard coordiante reference
systems listed by:


+ EPSG codes
+ OGC codes


These codes are used to look up an exhaustive formal definition of a
coordinate reference system. By describing your data in this manner
uDig can both work faster and with greater accuracy.



Custom CRS
----------

You can supply your own custom coordinate reference system using the
"Well Known Text" format.

Note: You can switch to this tab to review a "Standard CRS* definition
using WKT as a quick informal summary; or as a starting point for your
own custom definition.
