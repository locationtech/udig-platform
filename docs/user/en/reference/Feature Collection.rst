Feature Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vector data is represented as a collection of features; this
terminology comes from the Web Feature Server specification; which is
a web service that makes vector data available over the web as
"feature collections".

You can think of a feature collection as being the data; and the
feature type as being the data contents.
