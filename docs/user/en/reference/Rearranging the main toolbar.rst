Rearranging the main toolbar
----------------------------

You can rearrange sections of the main toolbar. Toolbar sections are
divided by a thin vertical line.


#. Make sure the toolbar is unlocked. The toolbar is unlocked if it
   has thick vertical bars next to the thin vertical toolbar dividers.
   (If it is locked, unlock the toolbar by right clicking the toolbar and
   selecting the Lock the Toolbars menu item.)
#. Grab the section of the toolbar you want to rearrange by moving the
   mouse over the thick vertical line on the left side of the desired
   segment. The mouse cursor changes its shape to indicate that you can
   click to move the toolbar section.
#. Click and hold the left mouse button to grab the toolbar section.
#. Move the section left and right or up and down. Release the mouse
   button to place it in the new location.
#. To prevent accidental changes to the toolbar lock it again by right
   clicking the toolbar and selecting the Lock the Toolbars menu item.
