North Arrow
###########

The North Arrow is available in two parts:

-  A new Map Graphic entry **North Arrow** that can be dropped onto your map; it will appear in the
   top left corner and will (gasp!) always point north
-  A new tool that can be used to position the north arrow on your map

This work is originally done with the help of a couple cool kids from Switzerland that did an
internship at Refractions Research.

How to add a North Arrow
------------------------

#. Drag and Drop the **North Arrow** map graphic onto your map
#. Change to the tool **Move Mapgraphic** tool (this is available under the JGrass tools)
#. Click on the screen to position the north arrow

Alternatively you can use the styling interface to assign a fixed location to the north arrow.
