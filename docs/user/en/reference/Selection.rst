Selection is not a simple concept because there are different types of
selection.

+ Layer Selection

Workbench Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workbench selection is determined by what is selected in the
current view. For example in the Layers view the selection will always
be a layer. In the Project Explorer the selection could be a project,
map, page, etc... The selection in the Map Editor depends on the tool
that is selected.

Layer Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each layer has a filter that indicates what is selected on that layer.



Edit Selection

The `EditBlackboard`_ contains the features that have been selected
for editing. At any one time a single feature on the edit blackboard
is the *edit feature*, the feature that has the vertex handles and can
directly be edited.
