       <h3>View</h3>
       <h2><a name="View-View"></a>View</h2>

<p>Views support editors and provide alternative presentations as well as ways to navigate the information in your Workbench. For example, the Projects view displays projects and other resources that you are working with.</p>

<p>Views also have their own menus. To open the menu for a view, click the icon at the left end of the view's title bar. Some views also have their own toolbars. The actions represented by buttons on view toolbars only affect the items within that view.<br/>
A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook. You can change the layout of a perspective by opening and closing views and by docking them in different positions in the Workbench window.</p>
