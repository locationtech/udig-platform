Cheat Sheet Selection Dialog
============================

1. Select **Help > Cheat sheets** from the menubar
> 2. Select one of the available cheat sheets and click <b>OK< b>.

You may also load a cheat sheet content file or from the internet.



Starting
========

Each cheat sheet has a list of steps and it always begins with an
Introduction step. When you launch a fresh cheat sheet, the
Introduction step is expanded so that you can read a brief description
of the cheat sheet. To start working with the cheat sheet, click Click
to Begin in that step. The next step is expanded and highlighted. You
should also see one or more actions buttons, such as Click to Perform
in the highlighted step. You can now begin working through the tasks
using the cheat sheet. At any time, the only highlighted step in the
cheat sheet is the current step.



Restarting
==========

Any time after starting a cheat sheet, you can restart from the first
step by clicking Click to Restart in the Introduction step. If you
have already created some artifacts, you will have to manually clean
up the workspace before restarting the cheat sheet.



Progressing to the next step
============================

In the current step, when you click Click to Perform , a tool (which
can be a wizard), will be launched and you will be required to work
with that tool. When you finish working with that tool, the next step
is automatically highlighted and it becomes the current step. When the
current step is a manual task, you will need to perform the work and
click Click to Complete to move to the next step. A check mark appears
in the left margin of each completed step.



Getting task help information
=============================

To get step-by-step instructions for that step, click the help link in
the step before you click Click to Perform , and the step-by-step
instructions on how to work with that tool will be displayed in the
Help window.

Additional help for entry fields in the tool or wizard may be
available by focusing on the field (use the Tab key to position to
that entry) and pressing F1.



Skipping a step
===============

If a current step has a Click to Skip option , then it is an optional
step. You must click Click to Skip to skip the current step, when you
do, the step will have the skip mark in the left margin. If the task
does not present Click to Skip, you must perform that step and you
cannot skip it.

Redoing a step

You can redo any step that you may have completed or skipped in the
current cheat sheet. To redo the step, expand the step by clicking its
expand icon and then clicking Click to Redo . After redoing a step,
the cheat sheet will continue from the redo step.



Closing
=======

When you finish the last step in a cheat sheet, it automatically
restarts. You can also close the active cheat sheet by clicking the
close icon in the cheat sheet's toolbar. The active cheat sheet saves
its completion status when it is closed so that you can continue where
you left off at a later time.
