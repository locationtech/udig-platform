Shapefile
---------

A Shapefile is a common file format which contains numerous features
of the same type. Each shapefile has but a single feature type.
The classic three files filename.shp shapes filename.shx shapes to
attributes index filename.dbf attributes Basic metadata filename.prj
projection Open source extensions filename.qix quadtree spatial index
filename.fix feature id index filename.sld style-layer-descriptor
style xml object ESRI extensions filename.sbn attribute index
filename.sbx spatial index filename.lyr arcmap-only style object
filename.avl arcview style object filename.shp.xml fgdc metadata
You can save any changes made to your shapefiles appearance by
choosing export from the Style dialog and saving a **sld** file.

If you are having trouble displaying your shapefile with other layers
you may be lacking a **prj** file. You may wish to look up a resonable
projection using the uDig CRS dialog (righ click on a map) and cut &
paste the result into a **prj** file using a text editor.
