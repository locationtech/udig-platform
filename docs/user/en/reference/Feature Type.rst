Feature Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The concept of a Feature Type is used to name and describe set of
vector data (known as a Feature Collection). This terminology comes
from the Web Feature Server specification; which is a web service that
publishes the definition of a feature types; along with vector data
that matches that type.

A Feature Type consists of several interesting parts:


+ a type name - this is the name of the content; it could be as
  informal as the filename that contains the content; or it could be a
  formal name provided the organization making the information
  available.
+ attribute types; describe the information recorded about the
  features
+ a default geometry; this is the geometry that is drawn on the map
  (unless you are more specific)


You can think of a feature collection as being the data; and the
feature type as being a description of that data.
