Rearranging the main toolbar
----------------------------

You can rearrange sections of the main toolbar. Toolbar sections are divided by a thin vertical
line.

#. Make sure the toolbar is unlocked. The toolbar is unlocked if it has thick vertical bars next to
   the thin vertical toolbar dividers.
   (If it is locked, unlock the toolbar by right clicking the toolbar and selecting the Lock the
   Toolbars menu item.)
#. Grab the section of the toolbar you want to rearrange by moving the mouse over the thick vertical
   line on the left side of the desired segment. The mouse cursor changes its shape to indicate that
   you can click to move the toolbar section.
#. Click and hold the left mouse button to grab the toolbar section.
#. Move the section left and right or up and down. Release the mouse button to place it in the new
   location.
#. To prevent accidental changes to the toolbar lock it again by right clicking the toolbar and
   selecting the Lock the Toolbars menu item.
