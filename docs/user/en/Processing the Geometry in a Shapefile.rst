Processing the Geometry in a Shapefile
######################################

You can use the **Reshape** operation to modify the geometry column and then export the resulting
scratch layer.

Converting Polygons to Points using Centroid
============================================

#. Select the contents of your shapefile

   -  Exapand the shapefile entry in the catalog view and select the contents
   -  Select the layer (if you happen to have the shape file on screen)

#. Run the **Transform** operations, this operation will show you a the current attributes being
   generated, along with their type and an expression used to calculate values.
#. Select **the\_geom** in the Transform table
#. Define the expression used to generate your geometry value:

   centroid(the\_geom)

#. Press **OK**. A new scratch entry containing the result of the operation has been added to the
   scratch service in the **Catalog view**.
#. Right click on the above scratch entry in the catalog view and select **Export** to open the
   :doc:`Export Wizard`

#. Choose **Resource to Shapefile** and press :guilabel:`Next>`
#. Provide a destination directory for your new shapefile
#. Ensure that your scratch entry is checked off for export
#. Press **Finish**
#. The new shapefile is now available in the **Catalog view**

You can define additional columns using any CQL expression, please be advised that the shapefile
format can only support one geometry column.

Converting Lines or Points into Polygons using Buffer
=====================================================

#. Select the contents of your shapefile

   -  Exapand the shapefile entry in the catalog view and select the contents
   -  Select the layer (if you happen to have the shape file on screen)

#. Run the **Transform** operations, this operation will show you a the current attributes being
   generated, along with their type and an expression used to calculate values.
#. Define the process desired for the **the\_geom** expression:

   ::

       buffer(the_geom,0.01)

#. Press **OK**. A new scratch entry containing the result of the operation has been added to the
   scratch service in the **Catalog view**.
#. Right click on the above scratch entry in the catalog view and select **Export** to open the
   :doc:`Export Wizard`

#. Choose **Resource to Shapefile** and press :guilabel:`Next>`
#. Provide a destination directory for your new shapefile
#. Ensure that your scratch entry is checked off for export
#. Press **Finish**
#. The new shapefile is now available in the **Catalog view**
