Clip Operation
##############

Computes the geometric difference between two Layers.

The *Clip Operation* takes the features from a *Clipping* **vector** *Layer* and a *Source*
**vector** *Layer* and uses them to compute the geometric difference between the *Source* and the
*Clipping* layers, and stores the result on a third *Layer*.

It is possible to use the selected features, if a selection is set, on both the *clipping* and the
*source* Layers to limit the scope of the operation.

Neither of the Layers used to compute the difference gets modified by any means, but a third Layer
is created by default, or the user could select an existing Layer where to store the result.

Sample Usage
------------

We'll start this usage example by selecting a single feature from the *municipalities* *layer* which
we'll use as the clipping mask against the *voting areas* *layer*.

*Figure 1* shows the selected Feature, "Victoria" on the municipalities layer.

Now go to the *Spatial Operations* View, and select *Clip* from the *Operation* drop down.
 The *Clip Operation*'s specific input options will show up.

Now is time to indicate the operation's inputs, as shown in *Figure 2*:

-  **Select the Source Layer**

   From the *Layer to Clip* drop down, select the Layer containing the Features to apply the
   difference to with the clipping Layer.
   
-  **Select the Using Layer**

   From the *Using Layer* drop down, select the layer to use as cutting mask.
   
-  **Select the** ***Result*** **Layer**

   At the *Result Layer* drop down, a tentative Layer name will be proposed for the layer the
   operation will create. You can change the name or select an existing Layer where to store the
   results.

      **Figure 2. Define input and target layers.**

-  **Perform the operation**

   Once the input and target layers are defined, press the *Perform* button at the *Spatial
   Operations* View tool bar. The operation will begin processing and its progress will be shown up
   on a progress dialog, as shown in *Figure 3*. The operation may take a while to complete,
   depending on the amount and complexity of the input geometries.

Once the Operation finishes, if a new Layer were created to hold the result, it will be
automatically added to the current Map.

*Figure 4* shows the newly created Layer (Clip-1, in green) added to the map, with the Features
resulting of applying the difference between the *Source* and *Clipping* Layers.
