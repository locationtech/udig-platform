EditBlackboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EditBlackboard is a construct that represents the features that are selected for editing. Using
the selection tools features can be added to the blackboard.

-  Clicking on a *non-selected* feature will clear the blackboard and add the feature to the edit
   blackboard.
-  SHIFT+click will add feaures to the EditBlackboard.
-  :kbd:`CTRL` + click will add a *non-selected* feature to the EditBlackboard and will remove a *selected*
   feature from the EditBlackboard.

There are a few benefits to adding features to the EditBlackboard.

#. Switching between features on the EditBlackboard is much faster than switching between
   non-selected features. Partly because the system doesn't have to communicate with the service and
   partly because changes made aren't applied to the features.
#. Vertices that are shared between features can be moved as one as if there is a coverage model.
   There isn't but the editing can almost behave as if there is.
#. There is a snapping mode that only searches the EditBlackboard. This allows the user to choose
   what features can be snapped to as well as making snapping much faster (the *real* data doesn't
   have to be searched).
