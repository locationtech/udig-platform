Workbench
---------

The term workbench refers to the desktop window that is displayed. The workbench contains editors
and views allowing you to interact with spatial information.

You can change what views and editors are displayed by changing "perspectives". Each perspective
defines an arrangement of views and editors allowing you to focus on one problem or activity.

Out of the box uDig includes:

* :doc:`Map Perspective <Map Perspective>` - used to work with and explore spatial information
* :doc:`Style Perspective <Style Perspective>` - used to work on styling spatial data in a distraction free environment
