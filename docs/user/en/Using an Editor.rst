Using an Editor
---------------

An :doc:`editor <Editor>` is a visual component within the :doc:`Workbench`. It is typically used to edit or browse
information.

Modifications made in an editor follow an open-save-close lifecycle model. Multiple instances of an
editor type may exist within a Workbench window.

Depending on the type of content that is being worked on, the appropriate editor is displayed in the
editor area. For example, if a map is being edited, a map editor is displayed in the editor area.

The figure below shows an editor open on the map continents. The name of the map appears in the tab
of the editor. Any changes made to the map will be saved when the editor is closed.

The editors can be stacked in the editor area and individual editors can be activated by clicking on
the tab of the desired editor. Editors can also be tiled side-by-side in the editor area so that
their content can be viewed simultaneously. In the figure below, editors for country and lakes have
been placed one beside the other. Instructions will be given later in this tutorial explaining how
to rearrange views and editors.
