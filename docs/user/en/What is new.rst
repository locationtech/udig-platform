Area of Interest
================

We now support the concept of :doc:`Area of Interest`:

-  This replaces the previous default value of "everything"
-  You can define an area of interest a number of different ways: current screen, a bookmark, the
   current projection
-  You can use Area of Interest to:

   -  Limit the contents of the :doc:`Table view`
   -  Limit the area you are searching for new data in the :doc:`Search view`
   -  Show All

For more information check out the Tasks section on :doc:`Working with AOI`

Tool Interaction
================

You can now control how a layer interacts with tools.

One great use of this facility is to quickly mark background layers so they do not get in the way of
what you are working on.

Tool Palette and Options
========================

Tools have gotten a major usability improvement featuring:

-  **ToolPalette** - used to quickly explore available tools, configure tool display to show labels,
   large icons or even descriptions for a helping hand when learning.

    By default the Palette is displayed along side your Map; you can also Choose **Show View >
   Other** and Open the Palette on its own as a tear off View. This is great for users with more
   than one monitor or when you have multiple maps open side by side. This is the same Palette used
   during Page printing.
-  **ToolOptions** - quick access to common tool preferences from the Map Status Line. This has
   allowed us to reduce the number of tools while maintaining the same functionality.

These change combine to make uDig even more User-friendly with a presentation of tools similar to a
paint program.

Cheatsheets
===========

Cheatsheets offer a great form of interactive help to supplement the existing uDig online help
reference
 material.

 Cheatsheets offer step by step instructions; with the ability to interactively take charge of the
application and show you the step that is being described.
