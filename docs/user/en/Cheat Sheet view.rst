Cheat Sheet view
################

Used to display the current cheat sheet offering guided step-by-step assistance in performing a
task.
Only one cheat sheet can be used at a time, although the system will remember what step you are on
when you close a cheat sheet.

A normal cheat sheet is displayed as a simple list of tasks.

A Composite Cheatsheet is displayed using a task explorer to review available tasks, and a tasks
detail pane to show the individual steps making up the selected task.
