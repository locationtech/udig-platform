Split Operation
###############

Split a polygon layer using a LineString layer

The *Split Operation* takes the features from the *split layer* (source) and uses the LineString
features from the *using layer* to split them.

The result of the *Split Operation* could be stored on a new layer, on an existent layer or on the
previously used source layer.

Sample Usage
------------

On this example we are going to do an split operation with the polygon layer edificios.shp and the
lineString layer carre1.shp.

 **Figure 1. Before operation.**

Go to the *Spatial Operations* View, and select *Split* from the *Operations list* .
 The *Split Operation*'s specific input options will show up.

Now is time to indicate the operation's inputs, as shown in *Figure 2*:

-  **Select the Source**
   From the *Split layer* drop down, select the Layer containing the Features to Split, this one
   will be our source layer.
-  **Select the Using**
    From the *Using Layer* drop down, select the layer to use as splitting mask.
-  **Select the Result**
   At the *Result Layer* drop down, a tentative Layer name will be proposed for the layer the
   operation will create. You can change the name or select an existing Layer where to store the
   results. Also, you can select the used source layer.

 **Figure 2. Define input and target layers.**

-  **Perform the operation**
   Once the input and target layers are defined, press the *Perform* button at the *Spatial
   Operations* View tool bar. The operation will begin processing and its progress will be shown up
   on a progress dialog, as shown in *Figure 3*. The operation may take a while to complete,
   depending on the amount and complexity of the input geometries.

Shows the newly created Layer (Split-1) added to the map, with the Features resulting of applying
the split operation between the *Split* and *Using* Layers.
