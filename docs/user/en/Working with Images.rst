Working with Images
###################

Image data is widely used as a source of geospatial data. Often images are used as a simple
background layer with the pixel colours providing content for information on screen. Raw raster
information is also used for more serious anaylisis where the information is treated as a grid
coverage of measurements for datasets such as a digital elevation model.
