Documents
---------

The documents are presented in a tree-table structure. Documents are grouped into folders that represent their associated feature or layer.

Within each folder several kinds of information are displayed:

|file_logo| - File Document (or the icon of the operating system's default program for file type)

|web_logo| - Web Document

|action_logo| - Action Document

Some layers and features support storing of documents as attachments. Attachments are copied into the application and managed along with the resource.

For features, specific attributes can be marked as a *hotlink* to reference a document. Hotlinks that are not currently set will show up as "Unassigned".
