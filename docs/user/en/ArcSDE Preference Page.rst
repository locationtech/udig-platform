ArcSDE Preference Page
######################

The ArcSDE Preference Page is used to configure ArcSDE support in uDig.

Configuration
=============

These settings are used to tell uDig where the "jars" are for version of ArcSDE. These jars are
included on your ArcSDE CD. We cannot distribute the jars with uDig.

ArcSDE Java SDK
---------------

This is a jar similar to "jsde-sdk-XX.jar" where XX is the version number of ArcSDE you are using.

Please copy this jar to your computer from the ESRI CD and hit Browse to tell uDig where the jar is.

Projection Engine:
------------------

This is a jar similar to "jsde-jpe-XX.jar" where XX is the version number of your ArcSDE server.
