You can create new projects by using the :menuselection:`File --> New` menu on the Workbench menubar.

Start by creating a simple project as follows:

#. From the menubar, select :menuselection:`File --> New --> Project`

#. In the New Project field, type a filename.
   (You may also use the Browse button)

#. Click Finish when you are done.

If you look at the Projects view, you will see that it now contains your new project.
