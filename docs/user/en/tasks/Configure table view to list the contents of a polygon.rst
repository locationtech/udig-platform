Configure table view to list the contents of a polygon
######################################################

We can use a AOI layer with the table view to list the contents of a selected polygon.

#. Use :ref:`preferences-page-project-layer` to configure your polygon layer as a **AOI** layer.
#. Open the **AOI** view and choose **AOI Layer**
#. Use the **AOI Selection** tool to choose a polygon. You can use Shift to select more than one
   polygon
#. Open the **Table** view to list the contents of a layer.
#. Choose the **AOI** filter on the **Table** view toolbar.
#. You can use the **AOI Selection** tool to quickly navigate through your data.

An example with the sample data set is:

-  Use countries as the AOI layer
-  Select Italy with the AOI tool
-  Use the table view to show the cities within Italy
