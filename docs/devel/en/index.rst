uDig Developer Guide
====================

Welcome to the uDig *Developer's Guide*. This guide is intended to help developers who want to
customize and build on top of the uDig core. uDig can be extended by adding standard Eclipse
plug-ins which work against either Eclipse or uDig extension points. Developers define their own
applications which combine existing and possibly new plug-ins.

If you are looking for help on eclipse concepts please do not start with google! You will have more
luck looking in the Eclipse Help menu because the contents match the copy of eclipse you are using
today.
