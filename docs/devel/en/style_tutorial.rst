-  Available in your uDig SDK (import the :doc:`source code <code_examples>` from the plugins
   view)

Introduction
------------

In this workbook we are going to create our own style content; and use it to control the CSVRenderer
created earlier.

We will be covering the following ideas:

-  styleContent - used to host a value on the style blackboard
-  stylePage - contributed to the style editor allowing the user to change values on the style
   blackboard
-  IMemento - eclipse interface used to advertise persistent storage

We will also revisit the RenderingMetrics contract covered in the last tutorial.

What to Do Next
---------------

For better understanding of these facilities please try the following:

Switch
^^^^^^

Can you arrange to switch between the ColorCSVRenderer and the CSVRenderer? What code do you need to
add to make this happen?

Hint: Consider what is going on with the style blackboard

User supplied Default Color
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Can you modify the code to read in a default color stored in a CSV file comment?

::

    # ff00cc

SLD
^^^

Advanced: The org.locationtech.udig.style.sld plug-in holds a GeoTools FeatureTypeStyle object on the
blackboard using the key SLDStyle.ID.

Adjust your ColorCSVRenderer to recognize **SLDStyle.ID** as well.

Hint: Use the SLD utility class to obtain a color from the first PointSymbolizer.

Hint: You should be able to drag and drop an sld file onto the layer to have it stored on the
blackboard. If you do not have an sld - open up a point layer and visit the advanced page of the
style editor. You can export this xml as an "sld" document.
