What to Do Next
===============

Here are some additional challenges for you to try. Each of these ideas results in a more professional looking application.

* Manually add the
  jre
  folder from the SDK Quickstart to the generated custom-1.0.0.zip file. This will let users of your application unzip and run.


* Try a wider
  about.gif
  image and see what that looks like.


* Try making window icons with a transparent section.


* The eclipse Search (
  Control-H
  ) can be used find all the available action sets.
  Try a Plug-in Search with the following parameters.

  Add a new perspective extension actionSet to get the 'Change Style...' layer menu entry shown below.

  Hint: New for Eclipse 3.5 there is now a “browse” button when adding an ActionSet.


* Add an “intro part” to your application to welcome new users.
  Remember to search in the eclipse help menu for documentation on how to do this – yes it is even better then trying to use google or koders.


* Add branding to the net.refractions.udig_tutorials.custom-feature feature. This is how you can get your organization's name included in the about box.


* Externalize all the translatable strings in the
  plugin.xml
  and the
  custom.product
  . You can also create language specific
  splash.bmp
  and
  about.gif
  images.


* Advanced: Perform a build from the command line, eclipse help has the details.
