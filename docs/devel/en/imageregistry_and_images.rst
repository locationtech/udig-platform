ImageRegistry and Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Plugin is responsible for any resource used, including management of `Icons <Icons.html>`_. SWT
wants us to manually manage our images, this includes creation and disposal.

+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Image             | a real image from the operating system, i.e. a limited resource   |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ImageDescriptor   | a placeholder that allows the image to be used as needed          |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Icons fall under the category of Images that are "used very frequently or must be shared among
several widgets for unknown lengths of time". This makes them a pain to manage on a per use basis.
The solution is to create a class to manage these resources and clean up after them.

This means we are allowed to keep an ImageRegistry of icons....

JFace and ImageRegistry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JFace provides an ImageRegistry yourself (it works like a Map that will dispose of the Images when
an associated Display is cleaned up).

::

    static final String ICON = "obj16/icon.gif"
    ImageRegistry registry = new ImageRegistry();

    ImageDescriptor desc = ImageDescriptor.createFromURL( );
    registry.put( ICON, desc);

JFace also offers a global JFaceResources class that provides a shared ImageRegistry.

**The Party Line**

There is a bit of a difference between the formal party line provided by the EclipseFAQ, and what
everyone is really doing.

Lets work through what is supposed to happen.

AbstractUIPlugin and ImageRegistry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chances are your plugin extends AbstractUIPlugIn - this means there is a ImageRegistry already to
go.

We simply need to supply the icons using the provided callback:

::

    public class MyPlugin extends AbstractUIPlugin {
           public static final String ID = "example.package.my"; //$NON-NLS-1$
           public static final String ICONS_PATH = "icons/";//$NON-NLS-1$
           public static final String PATH_ELOCALTOOL = ICONS_PATH+"elcl16/";
           public static final String ADD_CO = PATH_ELOCALTOOL + "add_co.gif";

           protected void initializeImageRegistry(
                    ImageRegistry registry) {

            Bundle bundle = Platform.getBundle(ID);
            IPath path = new Path( ImageConstants.ADD_CO );
            URL url = Platform.find(bundle, path);
            ImageDescriptor desc = ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(url);
            registry.put( ImageConstants.ADD_CO, desc);
        }

initializeImageRegistry is called during Plugin startup. An interesting thing to note is the use of
Platform.getBundle( ID ) to locate the correct url to start searching from.

Images are then available via:

::

    MyPlugIn.getDefault().getImageRegistry().getDescriptor( ImageConstants.ADD_CO )

ISharedImages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your icons need to be accessed from outside of your Plug-In a convention exists - provide the the
constants in a ISharedImages file.

The ISharedImage file need to be in a public directory:

::

    public interface ISharedImages {
        public static final String ICONS_PATH = "icons/";//$NON-NLS-1$
        public static final String PATH_ELOCALTOOL = ICONS_PATH+"elcl16/";
        public static final String IMG_ADD_COMMAND = PATH_ELOCALTOOL + "add_co.gif";
    }

External code can now make use of your Images:

::

    ImageRegistry images = MyPlugIn.getDefault().getImageRegistry();
    ImageDescriptor image = images.getDescriptor( ISharedImages.IMG_DATASTORE_OBJ );

Pragmatism
^^^^^^^^^^

The above is a lot of work, forces a lot of complexity on your PlugIn class. And is not actually
what several popular implementations are doing.

Here are some of the forces that are effecting real world implementations:

-  For images in very common use an shared Image, rather than a ImageDescriptor is made available
   via ISharedImage. This improves performance
-  The size of resource keys has started to be a problem in the broader Eclipse project. Allowing
   the use of shorter strings apparently is worthwhile
-  The need to publish Images for reuse with in a plug-in
-  Separation of concerns, taking image resource code out of the plug-in class

**ImageConstants**

To ease access to your icons create a ImageConstants based on the path to the resource in your icons
directory.

This class should be located in an internal package.

::

    public interface ImageConstants {
        public static final String PATH_ELOCALTOOL = "elcl16/";
        public static final String ADD_CO = PATH_ELOCALTOOL + "add_co.gif";
    }

We have removed the leading ICONS\_PATH in order to shorten key names.

**ISharedImage**

ISharedImage works just like before - only this time we can refer to some well know keys from
ImageConstants.

::

    public interface ISharedImages {
        public static final String IMG_ADD_COMMAND = ImageConstants.ADD_CO;
    }

Two out of three ISharedImage have defined methods:

-  getImageDescriptor( String key ) - allows access to a shared ImageDescriptor (any created Image
   must be disposed)
-  getImage( String key ) - allows access to a real shared Image that must not be disposed

We need something to implement ISharedImage, the PlugIn is responsible for keeping providing a class
implementing this interface.

**Images**

A utility class, created on PlugIn startup takes over the management of common images.

Usually when it comes time to actually use an Image you are working in a View.

Keeping track of your Images (in a cache) is a easy way to go:

::

    private Map imageCache = new HashMap();
            private Image getIcon(String icon) {
                //obtain the cached image corresponding to the descriptor
                Image image = (Image) imageCache.get(icon);
                if (image == null) {
                    ImageDescriptor id = Images.image( icon );
                    image = id.createImage();
                    imageCache.put(icon, image);
                }
                return image;
            }

The only trick being that you need to clean up the cache in your dispose method:

::

    public void dispose() {
            for (Iterator i = imageCache.values().iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
                ((Image) i.next()).dispose();
            }
            imageCache.clear();
        }

An alternative is using ImageRegistry instead of HashMap:

::

    private ImageRegistry imageCache;
    public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {
            imageCache = new ImageRegistry( parent.getDisplay() );
            ....
    }
