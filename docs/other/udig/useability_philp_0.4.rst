| With Phil                 |
|                           |
| -  Installed over old     |
|    version, when running, |
|    got a weird            |
|    combination of 0.3 and |
|    0.4.                   |
| -  Not much help on the   |
|    front page             |
| -  uDig User's Guide page |
|    doesn't work           |
| -  The first getting      |
|    started entry has no   |
|    page                   |
| -  'The Workbench' page - |
|    screen shot has        |
|    createMap button       |
| -  Screenshots in         |
|    multiple Operating     |
|    systems is confusing - |
|    should be same         |
| -  Can't view the help    |
|    while a dialog is open |
| -  'New Map' page doesn't |
|    really say what to do  |
| -  'New Map' Wizard, had  |
|    to type in Project     |
|    name                   |
| -  After creating a map,  |
|    user didn't know which |
|    project we were in     |
| -  Tutorial has two       |
|    layers in screenshot,  |
|    but instructions only  |
|    say to select one.     |
| -  'Using popup' tutorial |
|    doesn't use popup!     |
| -  Likes the layer icon   |
| -  Progress bar is small  |
|    and hard to see        |
| -  In the layer's view,   |
|    each layer has no      |
|    right click menu       |
| -  Looking for a legend   |
| -  Confused between       |
|    swamps,rivers in 'a    |
|    simple project' -      |
|    could not distinguish  |
|    between swamps as a    |
|    map and swamps as a    |
|    layer in the registry  |
| -  Adding a layer wizard  |
|    appears to be creating |
|    a map (fault           |
|    instruction)           |
| -  'Editors & views' -    |
|    explains how to do     |
|    things that should be  |
|    known before doing 'a  |
|    simple project'        |
| -  Editor's page causes   |
|    confusion - need to    |
|    make clearer the       |
|    difference between map |
|    in project & layer in  |
|    registry               |
| -  When map editor not    |
|    selected, cannot       |
|    access map tools       |
| -  Paragraph about        |
|    editing Doc file in    |
|    Windows is weird       |
| -  'Views' - should put   |
|    the mouse cursor in    |
|    the screenshot         |
| -  Reset Perspective is   |
|    disabled               |
| -  WMS view should not be |
|    there                  |
| -  Wanted to cancel       |
|    rendering - couldn't   |
|    find button. Tried     |
|    pressing ESC           |
| -  Maximized then         |
|    minimized before       |
|    rendering was          |
|    finished. uDig went    |
|    insane.                |
| -  Pleasantly surprised   |
|    that it saved maps     |
|    between executions     |
| -  Discovered that you    |
|    can open a map by      |
|    double clicking -      |
|    checked right click    |
|    menu first             |
| -  Coordinates are        |
|    aligned at the top,    |
|    not middle             |
| -  'Navigating Local      |
|    Registry' - confusing, |
|    doesn't really do      |
|    anything               |
| -  Importing->Import      |
|    Wizard, doesn't select |
|    in help frame          |
| -  Unable to see path to  |
|    shapefile in registry  |
| -  Unable to determine    |
|    projection for         |
|    shapefiles             |
| -  Doesn't like the way   |
|    zoom works             |
| -  Holding the mouse      |
|    button down and        |
|    rolilng the mouse      |
|    wheel in an attempt to |
|    zoom produces weird    |
|    results                |
| -  Both wheel directions  |
|    zoom out               |
| -  The delay when using   |
|    the wheel is annoying  |
| -  Both mouse icon and    |
|    pan button icon should |
|    be the same            |
| -  When panning, the old  |
|    view appears sometimes |
|    and cause confusion    |
| -  Panning icon should    |
|    change when it is held |
|    down                   |
| -  Disabled icons look    |
|    like they are cut off  |
| -  While panning around,  |
|    it zoomed to full      |
|    extents randomly       |
| -  zoom is very           |
|    un-intuitive           |
| -  zoom not responding    |
|    properly, user         |
|    frustrated             |
| -  can't figure out how   |
|    to delete layer from   |
|    map, explored right    |
|    click, menus           |
| -  took too long to zoom  |
|    to one feature (to     |
|    figure out how)        |
| -  moving vertex is the   |
|    same icon as pan       |
| -  explored how to turn   |
|    off editning           |
| -  Random blank view      |
|    space appeared         |
| -  Cannot remove items    |
|    from local registry    |
| -  Local Registry: remove |
|    button appears to be   |
|    grayed out, but is     |
|    clickable              |
| -  When opening a         |
|    previously used map,   |
|    it didn't zoom to full |
|    extents                |
| -  Local Registry to fast |
|    view, then dragged     |
|    out, it died           |
|    completely. attempted  |
|    to revive it with Show |
|    View. uDig eventually  |
|    died.                  |
| -  Once reopened, an      |
|    imported shapefile did |
|    not initially appear   |
|    in the registry. Once  |
|    the map was reopened,  |
|    it appeared.           |
| -  'Exiting the           |
|    workbench' icon in     |
|    help is wrong          |
