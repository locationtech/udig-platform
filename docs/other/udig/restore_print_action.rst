uDig : Restore Print Action

This page last changed on Nov 29, 2011 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

The PrintAction was removed during the 1.1.x release cycle and needs to be restored.

-  https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/UDIG-1654 Integration with Print Action
-  https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/UDIG-1654 Restore PrintAction to File Menu

Inspiration
-----------

Although printing to PDF is great and works well for most users; it does not actually allow us to
print to large format devices. When producing a detailed map at A0 sizes the size of a PDF file
becomes prohibitive. Making use of the Java2D printing API directly it carefully calls back to your
application in "stripes" allowing the application to carefully print to large format devices.

We tested this for uDig 1.0 with plotters and everything - please bring it back!

Proposal
--------

The proposal is fairly direction; restore the Print Action and hook it up to the native Print
command handler (using the Cut, Copy, Paste code as an example of how to do this).

-  Find a copy of PrintAction and update it to the 1.3.x series; may need to use PDFAction as an
   example here
-  Can test locally using a PDF Print Driver if you like
-  Document the result in online help
