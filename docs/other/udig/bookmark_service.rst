uDig : Bookmark Service

This page last changed on Nov 26, 2011 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

The concept of bookmarks provided by the Bookmark view can smoothly be advertised to the rest of the
application as a workbench service.

A BookmarkService is used to supply:

-  A list of bookmarks that both the BookmarkView and other views can access
-  The selected bookmark (in case anyone wants to use it as a reference - such as the boundary
   service)
-  The ability to add / remove bookmarks (so that other code can quickly capture a bookmark)

Inspiration
-----------

Inspiration comes from the `Area of Interest Service <Area%20of%20Interest%20Service.html>`__ which
can be accessed by the boundary view, navigation tools and tables. The boundary service can also be
updated from the boundary view and the boundary nav tool.

Proposal
--------

Provide a workbench service that stores, retrieves and updates bookmarks. Technically this would
involve the following components and tasks:

-  Create a Bookmark workbench service
-  Connect the BookmarkView to use the service
-  Connect the BoundaryView to use the service

   -  Create a bookmark boundary strategy
   -  Create a page in Boundary view for users to select a bookmark to define the boundary from

Example:

.. code:: code-java

    IWorkbench workbench = PlatformUI.getWorkbench();
    IBookmarkService bookmarkService = (IBookmarkService) workbench.getService(IBookmarkService.class);

    for( IBookmark bookmark : bookmarkService.getBookmarks(){
        System.out.println( bookmark.getName() );
    }

Questions:

-  Should we allow other parts of the application to list additional bookmarks in the BookmarksView?
   The use-case would be shared bookmarks; or bookmarks retrieved from a search
