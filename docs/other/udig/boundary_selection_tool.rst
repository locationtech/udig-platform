uDig : Boundary Selection Tool

This page last changed on Nov 23, 2011 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

Organisations often have administrative boundaries to work and report within. There needs to be a
quick way to select boundary/s from a layer and navigate to the selected area.

Inspiration
-----------

Inspiration partly comes from the processing region which can quickly draw and highlight areas.

Proposal
--------

|   

-   A Boundary Selection Tool would enable users to select and automatically zoom to polygon within
   a boundary layer. Holding shift would allow for multiple selection and control would add / remove
   from the existing selection. Zooming to the selection would occur on release.
-  The boundary view would also be updated to the current selection.
-  Sometimes an organisation has multiple administrative layers which form a hierarchy. In this case
   the tool would zoom to the selected administration boundary, update the boundary view to be the
   custom selection and then select the next boundary layer in the layer list. Right clicking would
   return to the previous boundary layer.

This proposal will require the completion of Layer Preference Page which will enable a layer to be
specified as a boundary layer
