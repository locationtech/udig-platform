Moving Grass And Netcdf Services From Jgrass To Udig

uDig : Moving Grass and netcdf services from JGrass to uDig

This page last changed on Jun 23, 2010 by jgarnett.

Motivation
==========

The motivation is to add new data formats to udig, which are extremely important in teh GIS world:

-  the Grass workspace catalog support + grass rasters visualization support
-  the netcdf gridded and non gridded dataset support

Proposal
========

The services are already available in JGrass and quite tested (GRASS already years now). So I would
like to move them into the uDig code base.

Status
======

Project Steering committee support:

-  Andrea Antonello: +1 (not sure if I can vote my own proposal though |image0|)
-  Jesse Eichar: +0
-  Jody Garnett: +0
-  Mauricio Pazos: +0
