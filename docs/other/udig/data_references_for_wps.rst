| One of the       |
| things that is   |
| starting to      |
| happen is the    |
| introduction of  |
| out of band data |
| streams:         |
|                  |
| -  WPS allows    |
|    for a web     |
|    process to    |
|    return a      |
|    reference to  |
|    the data;     |
|    that will be  |
|    uploaded to   |
|    an FTP site   |
|    when "it is   |
|    done"         |
| -  Catalogs list |
|    references to |
|    data as the   |
|    result of a   |
|    search        |
|                  |
| One of the most  |
| common formats   |
| for this kind of |
| thing (since     |
| this is the real |
| world) is a      |
| zipped shape     |
| file!            |
|                  |
| There is an      |
| existing GPL     |
| plugin for WPS   |
| that may be used |
| as a starting    |
| point if you are |
| interested in    |
| some BEPL / SOAP |
| goodness.        |
