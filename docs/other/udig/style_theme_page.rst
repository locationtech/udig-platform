uDig : Style Theme Page

This page last changed on Dec 04, 2011 by scotthendo.

Motivation
----------

The current Style Editor Theme page is not very well written and hard debug. In part this is due to
combing too much activity into a single screen.

Inspiration
-----------

The inspiration for this is fairly simple; split up the two activities so we can handle them clearly
(and trust that the code is easier to understand and test as a result).

Proposal
--------

We are going to break the page into two bits; so we have two user interfaces for you to consider as
part of this proposal.

**Theme Style Page**

This will be a simple table showing the current categorisation information; allowing users to edit
in much the same manner as today.

Clear buttons to **Add** and **Remove** rows; as this a generic theme editor and not restricted to
the limits of colour brewer 13 categories

Process the Style information into a Categorisation data structure on the blackboard:

-  We can have the existing implementation which generates it based on assumptions about mapping
   categories into individual Rules
-  We can add a new implementation that understands the Symbology Encoding Functions (i.e. Categoize
   Function) as a high performance option

**ColorBrewer Wizard**

The functionality of generating a theme from a summary of feature collection attributes can be
repackaged as a wizard. While we can have a button to launch this from the Theme Page; it should
also be available standalone (perhaps from an operation) to facilitate reuse by other workflows.

Please note that the GeoTools gt-brewer module contains all the logic here (and is considered "our"
module for uDig). So all the unit testing and so on will take place there; we will simply be
building a wizard front end for the same functionality.

The wizard also has excellent job support so we can provide feedback in the event it takes along
time to generate an attribute summary.
