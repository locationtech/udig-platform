| Reader and       |

| One interesting  |
| new format is    |
| KML, produced by |
| our friends over |
| on google earth. |
| It is a happy    |
| little vector    |
| format and is    |
| increasing in    |
| popularity. We   |
| have all sorts   |
| of amazing XML   |
| parsing mojo     |
| left over from   |
| dealing with     |
| "Geographic      |
| Markup           |
| Language",       |
| putting the two  |
| together would   |
| be a fun         |
| challenge for    |
| those that think |
| they know what   |
| they are doing   |
| Go ahead impress |
| me, tame the     |
| beast (note      |
| focus on display |
| is easier, but   |
| getting the data |
| would be more    |
| powerful).       |
|                  |
| Several other    |
| groups are       |
| interested in    |
| this bit of      |
| work:            |
|                  |
| -  GeoTools      |
|    Project       |
| -  52n           |
|                  |
| So there are     |
| lots of          |
| opportunities    |
| for              |
| collaboration!   |
