uDig : Feature Attribution Workflow

This page last changed on Jun 23, 2010 by jgarnett.

Motivation:
===========

To improve data entry for feature creation, it would be a good idea to introduce a simple workflow
where a dialog pops up and displays the form after the geometry is provided so that users can input
feature attributes. It would also be good if the same form is available in a view when editing
existing features.

Currently, feature attributes are defined and edited separately from the geometry. With a new
feature attribution workflow we would be helping users of uDig applications to ensure data entry
which is mandatory or highly desirable is actually done.

Inspiration
===========

The style configuration extension point can be used in both the Style Editor Dialog and in the Style
view. Property View supports a `tabbed
properties <http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Tabbed-Properties/tabbed_properties_view.html>`__.
We may be able to take advantage of this directly; or simply steam the visual presentation to enable
forms with lots attributes to be broken up.

Proposal:
=========

Make a feature attribute creation and editing panel for use in dialog and view

-  The suggestion is that the new page be made integral to the process of creating a feature in a
   simple workflow.
-  At the conclusion of the creation of the geometry, the wizard will pop up and present the user
   with appropriate feature data entry options.
-  The same panels used in the page would be shown as a feature editor when working with an existing
   selected feature. To accomplish this we will need to reduce the feature editor (which provides an
   entire view) extension point to provide just a panel (much like style configuration does
   already).

form needs to be displayed in a wizard or dialog when creating a new feature from a geometry

 

This functionality would replace the current "feature editor" extension point (which recommends a
view appropriate for editing the currently selected feature). This must be replaced as we need the
"form" provided as a panel (that can be located in a dialog or view in much the same manner as the
StyleConfigurator extension point).

Committer Support:

A vote of -1 requires an alternate suggestion; community members are invited to indicate
support/suggestions.

Documentation
=============

We will need to document this extension point with an example in the `Developers
Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/DEV/Home>`__ (for an accepted change). The
`User Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Home>`__ would need to be updated to
document the addition of a "Feature View".

Tasks
=====

This work is in support of two paid projects and will be available in draft form by the end of March
2010. The work is expected to be completed (documentation available in a public SDK release) by May
2010.
