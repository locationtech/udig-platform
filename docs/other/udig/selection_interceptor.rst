uDig : Selection Interceptor

This page last changed on Nov 29, 2011 by levi.putna@gmail.com.

Motivation
==========

Modify the selection query to add or remove features from the selection.

Inspiration
===========

Paragraph (and picture?) pulling together the ideas that went into your design. Could be as simple
as an existing Eclipse Extension Point (monkey see monkey do), or feedback coming out of a training
course. In particular try and sort out the concepts and terminology you are drawing from for the
proposal.

Proposal
========

Define your proposal at a technical level; for API changes we expect a BEFORE/AFTER code example;
for anything significant a class diagram is really helpful (photo of a white-board is fine). For
changes to documentation or project procedure you may want to provide a "Table of Contents" or
"Point Form" outlining the content to be created.

-  Use point form to describe
-  Don't repeat the contents of the picture (we can see that already)
-  You may need to use several pictures; or a sequence diagram
-  If you need a detailed design (or have a design document from your company) use a sub-page, or
   include it as an attachment.

Documentation
=============

Documentation change to `Developers
Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/DEV/Home>`__ or `Project
Procedures <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/ADMIN/Home>`__ (for an accepted change).

Tasks
=====

A list of the tasks needed to accomplish this change; if you prefer you can use a single Jira issue
with subtasks. It is important to include any deadlines so the community knows when you are working
to a schedule.
