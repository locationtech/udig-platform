uDig : Legend Decorator Improvements

This page last changed on Dec 04, 2011 by scotthendo.

Motivation
----------

The Legend Decorator was a quick bit of work done for a customer; as such it has been not really
supported by the community. We need to update it to support the new function based SLD
representation of a theme; check that it knows to ignore background layers; and ensure it does not
conflict with label generation.

Inspiration

Proposal
--------

Define your proposal at a technical level; for user interface proposals we really expect a mock-up
(photo of a white-board is fine, we recommend wireframesketcher if you can).

!Image.png!

-  Use point form to describe
-  Don't repeat the contents of the picture (we can see that already)
-  You may need to use several pictures; or a workflow diagram; to explain how the user interface is
   used
-  If you need a detailed design (or have a design document from your company) use a sub-page, or
   include it as an attachment.

Status
