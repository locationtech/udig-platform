uDig : Area of Interest Service

This page last changed on Nov 26, 2011 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

Zoom to extent often goes too far; when working with the bluemarble raster layer and another layer
that is only within a country, it would be good to be able to set my zoom to extent to a specified
area of interest (i.e. boundary or fence or limit).

A AOIService would be used to provide a filter extent for the Search view (replacing Within
Viewport).

Inspiration
-----------

The inspiration comes from the existing zoom to extent and search within viewport functionality and
Mylyn code filtering in eclipse.

Inspiration for this to be a workbench service comes from the evil hack used by Search view
currently (it performs reflection on the selected WorkbenchPart looking for a **getExtent** method).

Proposal
--------

Here is a quick picture of what we have in mind:

|image0|

Appearance:

-  The restrict to limit button (the blue A) in the search view will be a toggle button with an icon
   (similar to the mylyn icon).

Details:

-  The defined Limit will be stored on the Map Blackboard for each map
-  Programmers can access the global Limit as a workbench service; the workbench service will
   remember the value provided by the "last" map.
-  This LimitService is defined at the net.refractions.udig.catalog level (so it can be used by
   search view). In keeping with existing conventions we will add a helper method to PlatformGIS to
   look up the LimitService and get the current value.

Status
------

The current proposal for a name is Boundary Service

Documentation
-------------

Documentation change to:

-  `Users Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Home>`__ Reference pages for
   "AOI View"
-  `Developers Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/DEV/Home>`__ code example of
   accessing the AOIService

Tasks:

#. |image5| Initial interface wireframe for community review and feedback
#. |image6| Get feedback on the name (other possibilities include Limit, Fence, Extent or LimitArea)
#. |image7| Review from PSC member required (thanks Jody and Jesse)
#. |image8| Initial implementation in github fork
#. |image9| submit pull request to PSC for code review
#. |image10| Wait for pull request to be accepted; revise as needed

   -  |image11| Add extension point as per initial code review
   -  |image12| Move BoundaryView back to net.refractions.udig.ui
   -  |image13| Consistent use of extension point

#. |image14| Introduce a **BoundaryProxy** for lazy loading

   -  |image15| Process Region Boundary contribution

#. |image16| Boundary Page handling for BoundaryView allowing Bookmarks to be listed / selected

   -  |image17| Bookmark Boundary Contribution

#. |image18| Updated user guide documentation to include the Boundary View
#. |image19| developers guide with code example of use of BoundaryService and implementation of
   IBoundaryStrategy
#. |image20| Add a TableView toggle as a quick filter for the boundary limit
#. Updated!

   -  Customer feedback has asked that this be renamed Area of Interest (back to the original)
   -  Search View still requires an appropriate toggle button
