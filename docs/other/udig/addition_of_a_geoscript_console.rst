Addition Of A Geoscript Console

uDig : Addition of a Geoscript Console

This page last changed on Apr 02, 2013 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

Scritping is one of the powerful things in GIS. Non developers have the possibility to create great
automatisations through it.

The `geoscript project <http://geoscript.org/>`__ seems to have reached a good point and is used a
lot in important environments.

Being able to integrate an aided geoscript environment is one major improvement to get uDig some
power. The following image gives an idea of the result. For more information look
`here <http://jgrasstechtips.blogspot.it/2013/01/proposal-geoscript-console-in-udig.html>`__.

Proposal
--------

The Spatial Toolbox already handles groovy scritping and with the geoscript library in the game also
geoscript scripts.

The proposal is to migrate the standalone `JGrasstools JConsole
application <http://code.google.com/p/jgrasstools/wiki/JConsole>`__ into uDig and specialise it for
Geoscript as much as possible with command completion.

It will exploit the engine of the Spatial Toolbox for execution and Console feedback.

How it should look like:

Command completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Geoscript syntax will be supported in command completion:

Syntax coloring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Syntax coloring will support readability:

The text editor
---------------

The text editor builds on the RCP example of the Java editor, which now was converted to a `Html
editor <http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-text/development/rcp/examples/>`__.

Status
------

Project Steering committee support:

-  Andrea Antonello: +1
-  Jesse Eichar: +1
-  Jody Garnett: +1 (yay!)
-  Mauricio Pazos: +1
-  Frank Gasdorf: +1

A vote of -1 requires an alternate suggestion; community members are invited to indicate
support/suggestions.

Currently the project is carried on on the `rfc\_geoscript\_console
branch <https://github.com/uDig/udig-platform/tree/rfc_geoscript_console>`__.

Most of the code is here:
https://github.com/uDig/udig-platform/tree/rfc_geoscript_console/plugins/eu.udig.jconsole

In case of positive voting, it will be merged into uDig master, once the tasks are fullfilled.

Tasks:

#. |image6| AA: Migration of the JConsole code into uDig, attaching to the Spatial toolbox execution
   engine

   -  |image7| AA: This is existing code that needs to be brought from plain RCP to uDig
   -  |image8| AA: Review the headers in anticipation of the IP review (also note the BSD+EPL
      license etc...)
   -  |image9| AA: Include in the default product

#. |image10| AA: Addition of Geoscript syntax coloring and command completion
#. Initial pull request

   -  |image11| AA: https://github.com/uDig/udig-platform/pull/164
   -  |image12| JG: Review
   -  |image13| AA: IP check for missing headers and about.html (see `License
      Change <License%20Change.html>`__ and `License Change
      Examples <License%20Change%20Examples.html>`__)
   -  |image14| AA: Refactor classnames to say GeoScript (example JavaEditorDocumentProvider renames
      to GeoScriptEditorDocumentProvider) -> I am not sure about this. Apart of being a hassle, the
      proper thing might not be **Geoscript**, since technically speaking it is the wider
      **Groovy**. In fact it can even be **Java**, so from the coding side of view I would stick
      with the largest possible, which is Java itself. So I would not change it.

#. user-docs

   -  |image15| AA: Supply course material in March (Complete tutorial covering Geoscript in uDig)
   -  |image16| AA: JConsole Reference page, GeoScript Concept Page (consisting of link)
   -  JG: Update the what is new page to describe the new feature

#. |image17| developer documentation

   -  |image18| Link to Eclipse Docs on this subject, try for single code example
