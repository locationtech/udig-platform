| At the   |
| end of   |
| the day  |
| your     |
| code     |
| will be  |
| sorted   |
| into one |
| of the   |
| core     |
| modules  |
| (or a    |
| new core |
| module   |
| created) |

| Contribu |
| tions    |
| directly |
| to the   |
| uDig     |
| applicat |
| ion      |
| are      |
| welcome, |
| but it   |
| is often |
| fun to   |
| try out  |
| an idea  |
| in a     |
| communit |
| y        |
| module   |
| first.   |
| You will |
| notice   |
| many of  |
| the core |
| uDig     |
| develope |
| rs       |
| playing  |
| on the   |
| communit |
| y        |
| pages,   |
| this is  |
| how we   |
| keep the |
| SDK      |
| stable.  |
|          |
| If you   |
| have     |
| requeste |
| d        |
| a        |
| feature, |
| chances  |
| are one  |
| of the   |
| core     |
| develope |
| rs       |
| will ask |
| you to   |
| download |
| a        |
| prototyp |
| e        |
| from a   |
| communit |
| y        |
| page.    |
| After    |
| all if   |
| it does  |
| not meet |
| your     |
| needs    |
| there is |
| no       |
| reason   |
| to add   |
| it to    |
| the SDK  |
| until it |
| is       |
| ready.   |
