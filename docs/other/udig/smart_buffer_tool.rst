uDig : Smart Buffer Tool

This page last changed on Sep 21, 2012 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

Sometimes a user is working on a Polygon layer but only wants to draw a Point or line.

Inspiration
-----------

Converting a Point or Line to a Polygon usually involves applying a Buffer to the Point or Line, the
Point or Line line data must exist in a separate layer that supports the type of geometry, moving
the Buffered data over to your original Polygon layer can be a cumbersome process.

Proposal
--------

What if we can make use of the existing Point and Line tools and modify them to automatically apply
a buffer value to the Point or Line when working on a Polygon layer. The interactive PDF demo below
will demonstrate the idea in action.

NOTE, for the initial release I plan on only allowing users to modify the buffer value via the mouse
wheel and not via a field located in the Map status bar. This will be a future RFC and might be
generally useful for all tools. `Map Status Bar Tool
Options <Map%20Status%20Bar%20Tool%20Options.html>`__

-  If a point tool is selected and it is working on a Polygon layer the smart buffer will be
   activated.
-  If a point tool is selected and it is working on a point layer then a normal non buffered point
   will be drawn.
-  The amount of buffer can be adjusted using the mouse scroll wheel or via a form field.
-  A buffer value of greater than 0 must be used.
