| | The          |
| `User-friendly |
| Desktop        |
| Internet       |
| GIS <http://ud |
| ig.refractions |
| .net>`__       |
| for OpenGIS    |
| Spatial Data   |
| Infrastructure |
| s              |
| |  project     |
| (uDig) will    |
| create an      |
| open-source    |
| desktop GIS    |
| application,   |
| to make        |
| |  viewing,    |
| editing, and   |
| printing data  |
| from CGDI and  |
| local data     |
| sources simple |
| for            |
| |  ordinary    |
| computer       |
| users.         |
|                |
| | Open-source  |
| components are |
| a critical     |
| part of the    |
| `CGDI <CGDI.ht |
| ml>`__         |
| vision,        |
| because they   |
| |  allow       |
| organizations  |
| to deploy      |
| infrastructure |
| widely, in a   |
| distributed    |
| fashion,       |
| |  without     |
| incurring      |
| multiple       |
| licensing      |
| fees.          |
| Open-source    |
| components are |
| also the       |
| |  most        |
| tractable for  |
| fast support   |
| of new OpenGIS |
| interoperabili |
| ty             |
| standards.     |
|                |
| | There are    |
| already many   |
| different      |
| pieces of      |
| open-source    |
| software that  |
| implement      |
| |  OpenGIS     |
| server         |
| standards:     |
| `Mapserver <Ma |
| pserver.html>` |
| __             |
| implements     |
| `WMS <WMS.html |
| >`__,          |
| `GeoServer <Ge |
| oServer.html>` |
| __             |
| implements     |
| |              |
| `WMS <WMS.html |
| >`__           |
| and WFS\\-T,   |
| `Postgis <Post |
| gis.html>`__   |
| implements     |
| SFSQL,         |
| `DeeGree <DeeG |
| ree.html>`__   |
| implements     |
| `WMS <WMS.html |
| >`__           |
| and            |
| |              |
| `WFS <WFS.html |
| >`__,          |
| and so on.     |
| However, there |
| is not a       |
| single piece   |
| of desktop     |
| software       |
| capable        |
| |  of binding  |
| information    |
| from all these |
| servers        |
| together into  |
| a unified      |
| desktop view.  |
| |  uDig is the |
| open-source    |
| application    |
| which will     |
| bring          |
| `CGDI <CGDI.ht |
| ml>`__         |
| data sources   |
| to the         |
| |  desktop,    |
| and integrate  |
| them with      |
| local data     |
| sources for    |
| standard       |
| business       |
| |  processes â€” |
| data viewing,  |
| data editing,  |
| and data       |
| printing.      |
