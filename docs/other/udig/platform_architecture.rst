| The UDIG    |
| GISPlatform |
| is built    |
| around the  |
| concept of  |
| plug-ins to |
| the base    |
| Eclipse     |
| Rich Client |
| Platform.   |
| Several     |
| other       |
| well-known  |
| eclipse     |
| plug-ins    |
| are used,   |
| such as the |
| Eclipse     |
| Modeling    |
| Framework   |
| and the     |
| Graphic     |
| Modeling    |
| Framework.  |

| It is       |
| useful to   |
| consider    |
| the UDIG    |
| application |
| as a series |
| of Tiers    |
| each with   |
| different   |
| responsibil |
| ities       |
| and         |
| capabilitie |

|             |
| -  Tier 0:  |
|    The      |
|    Toolkits |
|    used,    |
|    such as  |
|    Geotools |
|    and      |
|    GeoAPI,  |
|    provide  |
|    useful   |
|    abstract |
| ions        |
|    (such as |
|    Features |
| )           |

| actions.udi |
| g.libs      |
|    plugin   |
|    so they  |
|    may      |

| -  Tier 1:  |
|    Catalog  |
|    Services |
|    provide  |
|    a common |
|    API for  |
|    data     |
|    access   |
|    and may  |
|    serve as |
|    foundati |
