| | You can use    |
| our `JIRA Issue  |
| tracker <http:// |
| jira.codehaus.or |
| g/browse/UDIG>`_ |
| _                |
| to report a bug  |
| by creating a    |
| new issue.       |
| |  To create an  |
| issue:           |
|                  |
| -  Create a new  |
|    account       |
| -  Login.        |
| -  Once you are  |
|    logged in you |
|    can create a  |
|    new issue.    |
|                  |
|    -  be sure    |
|       that uDig  |
|       is         |
|       selected   |
|       as the     |
|       project    |
|    -  When       |
|       logged in  |
|       there will |
|       also be a  |
|       "Create    |
|       New Issue" |
|       link on    |
|       the uDig   |
|       JIRA home  |
|       page.      |
|                  |
| | When creating  |
| a new issue be   |
| sure to fill out |
| all the relevant |
| fields.          |
| |  Filling out   |
| all fields is    |
| specially        |
| important for    |
| bug reports,     |
| including        |
| components,      |
| affected         |
| versions, and    |
| environment      |
| |  You may wish  |
| to attach log    |
| files, or screen |
| snapshots to the |
| Jira task        |
| |  Besides a     |
| description of   |
| the problem,     |
| some additional  |
| information is   |
| also useful when |
| reporting bugs.  |
| |  The version   |
| of uDig          |
| application you  |
| are using (a     |
| release or code  |
| from CVS ?)      |
| |  A description |
| of what caused   |
| the problem      |
| (example code    |
| that reproduces  |
| the problem)     |
| along with any   |
| stack traces     |
| |  The Java      |
| Version and the  |
| type of          |
| operating system |
| you are using    |
|                  |
| On creation a    |
| notification     |
| will             |
| automatically be |
| sent to the      |
| geotools-devel   |
| list. JIRA sends |
| notifications    |
| for everything   |
| done on the      |
| issue, to the    |
| reporter, the    |
| assignee, and to |
| anyone who       |
| clicks on the    |
| link to 'watch'  |
| an issue.        |
