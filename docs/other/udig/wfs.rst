| The OGC Web      |
| Feature Service  |
| (WFS) interface  |
| is a collection  |
| of operations    |
| (implemented as  |
| messages carried |
| over HTTP) for   |
| retrieving and   |
| manipulating     |
| geographic       |
| features. An     |
| implementation   |
| of the OGC WFS   |
| IS allows a      |
| client to        |
| retrieve and     |
| update           |
| geospatial data  |
| encoded in       |
| Geography Markup |
| Language (GML)   |
| from one or more |
| Web Feature      |
| Services.        |

|    an XML        |
|    encoding for  |
|    the transport |
|    and storage   |
|    of geographic |
|    information,  |
|    including     |
|    both the      |
|    geometry and  |
|    properties of |
|    geographic    |
|    features.     |
