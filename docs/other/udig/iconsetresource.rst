uDig : IconSetResource

This page last changed on Sep 21, 2012 by jgarnett.

Motivation
==========

We would like to have an easy way to teach the uDig system about additional icon sets to use when
defining styles.

The Symbology Encoding specification calls these things **marks**, **graphics** or **external
graphics** depending on how they are defined. I am going to stick to the word **Icon** in the hope
of preventing confusion?

Add a Symbology Resource to the catalog so that it can be reused by other projects, layers and
styles.

This was pr

Inspiration
===========

Inspiration comes from the current reuse of geoResources; and the ability of GeoTools icon factories
to hook into the rendering engine.

Proposal
========

The proposal is to support the following kind of icon sets; users would import these into the uDig
application and have access to them in the **Style Editor**.

We would represent a **Symbology** data structure with implementations based on:

-  True Type Font
-  Directory of PNG or SVG files
-  ZIP of PNG or SVG files

Notes:

-  We are importing these into the Local Catalog; in part to check the API works when considering a
   remote catalog
-  A shape file with a bunch of icons in the same directory should also be able to resolve to this
   same **IconSet** data structure.

UI
--

Implement an **Import wizard** that will allow the importing of a **IconSet** to the local catalog.

Add another page to the point style dialog, this will work in the same mana as the font selection
tool however the first tab will allow users to select from a Symbology Resource.

API

|image2|

-  Use point form to describe
-  Don't repeat the contents of the picture (we can see that already)
-  You may need to use several pictures; or a sequence diagram
-  If you need a detailed design (or have a design document from your company) use a sub-page, or
   include it as an attachment.
