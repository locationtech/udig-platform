uDig : Move support for geopaparazzi projects from BeeGIS to uDig

This page last changed on Jun 16, 2012 by moovida.

Motivation
----------

Currently only BeeGIS is able to import Geopaparazzi collected datasets.

Geopaparazzi is a simple digital field mapping tool for android smartphones. The homepage is
`here <http://code.google.com/p/geopaparazzi/>`__.

For those who do not know Geopaparazzi, at `this
link <http://jgrasstechtips.blogspot.it/search/label/geopaparazzi>`__ you can find lot's of
information and use cases.

Proposal
--------

Since it is not a lot of code to add, it would be nice to have that support moved to uDig.

Basically that would imply a wizard. A description of `the actual process in BeeGIS is
here <http://code.google.com/p/geopaparazzi/wiki/GeopaparazziAndBeegis>`__.

Geopaparazzi data are then imported as follows:

-  geonotes
-  simple geonotes are imported as a point shapefile with attributes: timestamp, description (the
   note's text)
-  notes that have also a form are imported split on different shapefiles, one for each form type
-  gps logs: imported as line layer with track name and start-end timestamp
-  media: imported as point layer, having an attribute that containes the relative path to the
   images, starting from the position of the shapefile

| The only thing that BeeGIS does way better, is the handling of the images, which are imported in a
database. and it is possible to open them with a mouseclick from the map view.
|  It would be amazing to have uDig identifying layers that contain paths to media files, but right
now also having just the path or image name would be something.

I would not add a new plugin for this, I would simply add this small change to the jgrass.tools
plugin if that is ok for eveyone.

Status
------

Project Steering committee support:

-  Andrea Antonello: +1
-  Jesse Eichar:
-  Jody Garnett:+1
-  Mauricio Pazos:+1
-  Frank Gasdorf: 0

A vote of -1 requires an alternate suggestion; community members are invited to indicate
support/suggestions.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation change to `Users Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Home>`__
(for an accepted change).

JIRA issue is here: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/UDIG-1917

Tasks
=====

A list of the tasks needed to accomplish this change; if you prefer you can use a single Jira issue
with subtasks. It is important to include any deadlines so the community knows when you are working
to a schedule.
