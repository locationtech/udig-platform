uDig : Review Simple Style Pages

This page last changed on Dec 04, 2011 by scotthendo.

Motivation
----------

Moovida has done a great job with the Simple Style pages (for Point, Line and Polygon). This
proposal is to check these pages against the user interface guidelines; and perform a QA run to
reduce startup time and help responsiveness. We will also pull out the "predefined" styles into a
separate page so there is more screen area to work with.

Inspiration
-----------

Moovida is always inspiring; however it would be nice to remove the word "Simple" from these pages
on the off chance someone finds them complicated.

Proposal
--------

Define your proposal at a technical level; for user interface proposals we really expect a mock-up
(photo of a white-board is fine, we recommend wireframesketcher if you can).

-  Use point form to describe
-  Don't repeat the contents of the picture (we can see that already)
-  You may need to use several pictures; or a workflow diagram; to explain how the user interface is
   used
-  If you need a detailed design (or have a design document from your company) use a sub-page, or
   include it as an attachment.
