uDig : Filter Buttons for Layer View

This page last changed on Sep 21, 2012 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

The Layer view is great at showing draw order; problem is it is hard to concentrate on what is going
on with your data with all the "extra" non data stuff in the mix.

Inspiration
-----------

The eclipse ui guidelines has a convention of filtering views:

-  You can filter an outline view (the view toolbar has buttons hide non public members; or hide
   fields )
-  Myler mode can filter out extra stuff you are not interested in

Proposal
--------

We would like to add the following to the **Layer** view toolbar:

-  **Hide Background Layers**
-  **Hide Decorators**
-  **Hide non data layers**
