Results Based Process View

uDig : Results based Process View

This page last changed on Nov 23, 2011 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

By focusing on the process we lose track of the data; and the central metaphor of a layer.

The ability to work with processes, defined locally or via a web process service, in the current
system:

#. IProcess in the the catalog, and the WPS community module
#. From the catalog a process can be executed (a view is opened allowing the user to both specify
   parameters and actually run the process)
#. The results of a process are ... placed in the scratch area of the catalog where they may be
   viewed or saved to disk

Inspiration
-----------

The idea is to focus on the "temporary" results in a specific view. The results can adapt to
IGeoResource (and thus integrate with the rest of the system); and can represent both local results
stored in memory; and results that have been generated to an external FTP server.

By handing results as a first class object we can remember the process that produced the result; and
rerun if needed. Results that are currently being produced (ie representing a running process) can
be shown as working with a progress bar.

Consider this a combination of the catalog view and the existing eclipse progress view.

Proposal
--------

The process view can display a list (or tree?) of the generated results; to add a new result a
wizard is used to choose an appropriate process and "execute".

-  An executed process shows up in the list right away; with a progress bar indicating it is being
   produced
-  Actions could be listed for each results (from cancel, to rerun, add to map, etc...) or supplied
   via a context menu
