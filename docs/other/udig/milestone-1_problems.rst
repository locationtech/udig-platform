|           |
| | The     |
| GeoAPI    |
| library   |
| provides  |
| the Java  |
| GIS       |
| community |
| with a    |
| common    |
| set of    |
| |         |
| interface |
| s         |
| based on  |
| OGC       |
| standards |
| .         |
| Recently  |
| the GO-1  |
| initiativ |
| e         |
| has been  |
| |         |
| brought   |
| before    |
| the OGC   |
| as a      |
| common    |
| object    |
| represent |
| ation     |
| of OGC    |
| concepts  |
| |  across |
| object    |
| oriented  |
| languages |
| .         |
|           |
| | Several |
| of the    |
| changes   |
| made to   |
| GeoTools  |
| to track  |
| the       |
| GeoAPI    |
| and the   |
| GO-1      |
| |         |
| initiativ |
| e         |
| have      |
| resulted  |
| in a      |
| reduced   |
| feature   |
| set       |
| during    |
| the       |
| porting   |
| process.  |
| The       |
| |         |
| GeoTools  |
| 2.1       |
| branch    |
| has been  |
| scheduled |
| to host   |
| the new   |
| capabilit |
| ies       |
| required  |
| for       |
| |  the    |
| uDig      |
| project.  |
| The       |
| creation  |
| of this   |
| branch    |
| has been  |
| delayed   |
| due to    |
| GeoAPI    |
| and       |
| |  the    |
| GO-1      |
| initiativ |
| e.        |

| | At a    |
| functiona |

| level the |
| impact on |

| GeoTools  |
| library   |
| is        |
| limited   |
| to        |
| reproject |

| |  The    |
| uDig      |
| Project   |
| does not  |
| require   |
