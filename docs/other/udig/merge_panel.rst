uDig : Merge Panel

This page last changed on Sep 21, 2012 by jgarnett.

Motivation
----------

Move the Merge View used as part of the split and merge tool into a Panel so that it can be used in
either a view or a dialog.

Inspiration
-----------

Mauricio is bringing the split and merge tools back into uDig core; LISAsoft would like a chance to
collaborate with him on this work.

Proposal
--------

As soon as this is done I would like to isolate a section of the Merge view into a reusable panel so
it can be shared between uDig and a commercial project I am working on.

As such the Merge Panel would be a public API addition; and documented in the developers guide.

The responsibility of the panel is simple: the thunder dome principle of feature editing (two
features enter; one feature leaves).

The proposal is to make this available as a panel; for use both in the existing Merge view; and also
in a Merge Dialog.

Status
------

Project Steering committee support:

-  Andrea Antonello: +0
-  Jesse Eichar: +0
-  Jody Garnett: +0
-  Mauricio Pazos: +0

Committer Support:

-  

A vote of -1 requires an alternate suggestion; community members are invited to indicate
support/suggestions.

Documentation
-------------

This will not result in any user guide documentation change.

The developers guide will need a code example showing how to use a Merge Dialog.

Tasks
