uDig : Grid Improvements

This page last changed on Dec 04, 2011 by scotthendo.

Motivation
----------

The GeoTools library has a great new set of classes for generating grids. We would like to make use
of them to provide a better experience that respects the coordinate reference system; and produces
grids that curve to follow the shape of the earth.

We expect a couple of improvements to the grid style page as part of this; hence the UI RFC.

Inspiration

Proposal
--------

Define your proposal at a technical level; for user interface proposals we really expect a mock-up
(photo of a white-board is fine, we recommend wireframesketcher if you can).

!Image.png!

-  Use point form to describe
-  Don't repeat the contents of the picture (we can see that already)
-  You may need to use several pictures; or a workflow diagram; to explain how the user interface is
   used
-  If you need a detailed design (or have a design document from your company) use a sub-page, or
   include it as an attachment.
