| It would be great if uDig |
| could serve as a home for |
| ESRI refugees using       |
| Avenue scripts. Can we    |
| convert them to something |
| else and maintain that    |
| functionality?            |
|                           |
| Ideas range from the use  |
| of **scala**, to making   |
| use of your own           |
| interpreter. Most of the  |
| work would go into        |
| setting up adapters so    |
| that the Avenue scripts   |
| can see an object model   |
| that is familiar to them. |
