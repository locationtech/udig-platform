| Hello,     |
|            |
| I found    |
| JUMP       |
| through    |
| freegis.or |
| g          |
| and it     |
| seems to   |
| be exactly |
| what I     |
| need for a |
| project I  |
| am         |
| currently  |
| working    |
| on. What I |
| need it to |
| do is for  |
| me first   |
| download a |
| streetmap  |
| of British |
| Columbia,  |
| then to    |
| enter      |
| addresses  |
| and to     |
| have JUMP  |
| pinpoint   |
| them, then |
| to do some |
| network    |
| analysis.  |
| I believe  |
| this is    |
| all        |
| possible.  |
|            |
| I was      |
| wondering  |
| where I    |
| can find   |
| the        |
| informatio |
| n          |
| on how to  |
| download   |
| JUMP and   |
| install    |
| it. I have |
| Windows XP |
| and I was  |
| looking at |
| your       |
| download   |
| page and   |
| am unsure  |
| if I need  |
| to         |
| download   |
| all four   |
| files or   |
| just the   |
| Windows    |
| Installer. |
| When I     |
| download   |
| the        |
| Windows    |
| Installer  |
| and try to |
| open it    |
| nothing    |
| happens.   |
| Could you  |
| please     |
| direct me  |
| to a       |
| document   |
| that       |
| explains   |
| the        |
| installati |
| on         |
| process?   |
|            |
| Thank-you  |
| very much, |
|            |
