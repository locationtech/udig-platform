| Yahoo!      |
| Pipes is    |
| available   |
| at          |
| http://pipe |
| s.yahoo.com |
| ,           |
| and is an   |
| amazing     |
| free visual |
| editor for  |
| building    |
| data        |
| manipulatio |
| n           |
| pipes on    |
| the         |
| internet,   |
| consuming   |
| internet    |
| sources and |
| publishing  |
| the results |
| in RSS, XML |
| or JSON.    |
| They        |
| include a   |
| geocoding   |
| service, so |
| data that   |
| can be      |
| correlated  |
| to          |
| geographic  |
| locations   |
| can be      |
| published   |
| to maps,    |
| and they    |
| include     |
| examples of |
| this, one   |
| of which    |
| takes US    |
| census      |
| data, sums  |
| by state,   |
| geo-locates |
| the states  |
| and         |
| publishes   |
| points with |
| the states  |
| populate to |
| a map of    |
| the US.     |
|             |
| We should   |
| be able to  |
| create a    |
| catalog     |
| plugin that |
| can consume |
| such a      |
| resource    |
| and make it |
| available   |
| to the map. |
| This idea   |
| is related  |
| to the      |
| GeoJSON     |
| Support     |
| idea        |
| already     |
| prototyped  |
| in the      |
| 'amanzi     |
| wireless    |
| explorer'   |
| project,    |
| and there   |
| is a        |
| reasonable  |
| chance we   |
| will write  |
| a prototype |
| for Yahoo!  |
| Pipes in    |
| the near    |
| future.     |
