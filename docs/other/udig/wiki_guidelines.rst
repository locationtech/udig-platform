Welcome to the wiki, if you are reading this page you are a rare individual:

-  you have an interest in updating the uDig documentation
-  and you are reading directions before jumping in

So to start with - thank you for your help.

The uDig website is divided into several spaces:

We have divided the documentation into two categories categories:

-  Website - top level website with news and annoucements
-  Help - site used to export out content as an eclipse help plugin

Here are a few short cuts to get you going:

-  `Procedures <Procedures.html>`__ - uDig policy and procedure
-  `Programmer Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/DEV/Programmer+Guide>`__
-  `Getting Started <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Getting+Started>`__ -
   tutorials on the use of the uDig Application
-  `Tasks <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Tasks>`__ - categorical instructions
   using on the uDig Application
-  `Concepts <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Concepts>`__ - explainations of GIS
   ideas and terms

The wiki also plays host to other useful information including design discussions.

Guideines for writing Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| For the help spaces very strict writing guidelines are in order (see
`Home <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Home>`__.
|  Please limit image with to 600 pixels so end users can safely print out help contents.

Use of pages and Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link early link ofen, and the pages will come. Feel free to link to pages that don't exist yet, or
to terms a reader may not know.

Create a page for each commonly used term, so that writing of content can flow a bit better.

Compare & Contrast:

::

    The design of the [GCE] was influenced by the [WMS] specification.

To:

::

    The design of the [GCE|Symbols, Terms and Definitions#GCE] was
    influenced by the [WMS|Symbols, Terms and Definitions#WMS] specification.

The way to make this manageable is to have [EN:Glossary] as the parent page. The Gloassary page will
link to all is childern using a Macro. If you want to go the extra mile you can provide a more
specific parent page like OGC Specifications, GIS Terms, Definitions and we can have a information
heirachy.

Use of Attachments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The confluence system allows the use of images:

#. Upload the picutre as an attachment
#. Refer to it: ``!my-image.png!``

Use of Export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Export to PDF and html work. The series of check boxes used to specify each page is a bit clunky but
life will go on.

There are explicit directions on `Home <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/EN/Home>`__
for exporting out help pages.
