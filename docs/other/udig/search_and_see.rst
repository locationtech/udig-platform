| One mantra for   |
| uDig is "search  |
| and see", we     |
| have support for |
| a very limited   |
| search service   |
| for finding free |
| spatial data (we |
| populate a       |
| database based   |
| on some google   |
| searches and     |
| then access it   |
| via a web        |
| service). We     |
| also have tied   |
| in a "location"  |
| view that lets   |
| you search for a |
| location based   |
| on an address.   |
|                  |
| What other kind  |
| of things would  |
| be worth         |
| searching for?   |
| What other       |
| things can you   |
| see on a map?    |
|                  |
| Here are a       |
| couple of ideas: |
|                  |
| -  Yahoo - armed |
|    with only a   |
|    yahoo id you  |
|    can unlock    |
|    their         |
|    geocoder and  |
|    use their     |
|    search engine |
|    to find more  |
|    spatial       |
|    content       |
| -  GeoNetwork -  |
|    the           |
|    GeoNetwork    |
|    project has a |
|    spatial       |
|    catalog built |
|    and ready to  |
|    go, we just   |
|    need someone  |
|    to write a    |
|    plug-in to    |
|    support it!   |
