Switch Dependency Management From Ant To Maven3

uDig : Switch dependency management from ant to maven3

This page last changed on Oct 19, 2011 by jgarnett.

Motivation
==========

It comes down to the drastic speed increase, especially for those with a Nexus, and I would like to
tie the fetching of uDig libs directly into the automated build lifecycle. *One script to rule them
all*.

Inspiration
===========

I am already adding maven3 scripts to uDig to enable automated build. During my time learning maven
and tycho, I discovered maven was capable of improving on the ant refresh.xml script already in
place. The speed increase was noticeable, and for those with a Nexus in place, rather dramatic. Ant
script takes ~46 minutes to run in our network even with a nexus, the equivalent Maven3 script takes
~11 minutes without a nexus and ~44 seconds with a nexus.)

Proposal
========

-  Write a maven script that is able to replicate what the current refresh.xml ant script does.
-  Both are able to co-exist without having to remove one or the other.
-  In future, the ant script can be removed once the community is happy with the maven
   functionality.

Status
======

Project Steering committee support:

-  Andrea Antonello: +0
-  Jesse Eichar: +0
-  Jody Garnett: +0
-  Mauricio Pazos: +0

A vote of -1 requires an alternate suggestion; community members are invited to indicate
support/suggestions.

Documentation
=============

Documentation change to `Developers
Guide <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/DEV/Home>`__ or `Project
Procedures <http://udig.refractions.net/confluence//display/ADMIN/Home>`__ (for an accepted change).

The docco will not need to be updated until the maven functionality is well and truly tested. I
would assume the maven functionality will be stable in time for the next uDig release.

Tasks
=====

A list of the tasks needed to accomplish this change; if you prefer you can use a single Jira issue
with subtasks. It is important to include any deadlines so the community knows when you are working
to a schedule.
