| They   |

| In     |

| need   |
| the    |
| possib |
| ility  |

| This   |
| could  |

| look   |

| Where  |
| the    |
| right  |
| panel  |
| should |
| be     |
| able   |
| to     |
| load   |
| and/or |
| store  |
| user   |
| tables |
| to     |

| Once   |
| the    |
| panel  |
| has    |
| been   |
| create |
| d      |
| by the |
| user,  |
| the    |
| user   |
| should |
| be     |
| able   |
| to     |
| save   |
| it to  |
| disk   |
| in     |
| some   |
| xml    |
| format |
| ,      |
| in     |
| order  |
| to be  |
| able   |
| also   |
| to     |
| change |

|        |
| My     |
| idea   |
| in     |
| this   |
| was to |
| add a  |
| **shap |
| efile\ |
| _name. |
| form** |
| file   |
| to a   |
| shapef |
| ile,   |
| so     |
| that   |
| if the |
| shapef |
| ile    |
| that   |
| is     |
| loaded |
| into   |
| the    |
| udig   |
| map    |
| has    |
| the    |
| form   |
| file,  |
| the    |
| abilit |

| Sure   |
| that   |
| would  |
| not    |
| work   |
| for    |
| remote |
| layers |
| ,      |
| but in |
| that   |
| case   |
| the    |
| form   |
| abilit |
