| Styling in  |
| UDIG is     |
| designed to |
| be flexible |
| because     |
| different   |
| renderers   |
| require     |
| styles. For |
| example, a  |
| renderer    |
| based on    |
| Geotools    |
| requires    |
| Geotool's   |
| SLD         |
| objects.    |
| Since SLD   |
| is the      |
| standard    |
| style it is |
| tempting to |
| only        |
| support SLD |
| styles.     |
| However,    |
| doing so    |
| requires    |
| all         |
| renderers   |
| to support  |
| SLD styles, |
| which would |
| require     |
| extreme     |
| refactoring |
| for some    |
| rendering.  |
|             |
| One of the  |
| goals of    |
| UDIG is to  |
| be flexible |
| and provide |
| many        |
| options for |
| extension.  |
| Therefore,  |
| style       |
| objects are |
| unknown to  |
| UDIG. The   |
| only        |
| requirement |
| is a style  |
| much        |
| implement   |
| the         |
| ``net.refra |
| ctions.udig |
| .project.re |
| nder.Style` |
| `           |
| interface.  |
| The Style   |
| interface   |
| has only    |
| one method, |
| ``createMem |
| ento()``,   |
| which       |
| creates a   |
| ``net.refra |
| ctions.udig |
| .project.re |
| nder.StyleM |
| emento``    |
| object.     |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| objects are |
| the only    |
| style       |
| objects     |
| that UDIG   |
| is          |
| concerned   |
| with.       |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| is an       |
| implementat |
| ion         |
| of the      |
| Eclipse     |
| ``IMemento` |
| `           |
| interface   |
| and is used |
| to persist  |
| the style   |
| information |
| .           |
| When a      |
| renderer is |
| created it  |
| is passed   |
| the         |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| interface   |
| and is      |
| evaluated   |
| to          |
| determine   |
| whether the |
| renderer    |
| can use the |
| memento.    |

| A plugin    |
| that        |
| defines a   |
| style       |
| (Note: a    |
| single      |
| plugin      |
| could       |
| define a    |
| style and a |
| renderer)   |
| must        |
| implement a |
| ``net.refra |
| ctions.udig |
| .project.re |
| nder.StyleE |
| ditor``     |
| and a class |
| that        |
| implements  |
| the Style   |
| interface.  |
| The         |
| ``StyleEdit |
| or``        |
| interface   |
| extends     |
| eclipse's   |
| ``IDialogPa |
| ge``        |
| interface   |
| and         |
| contains an |
| additional  |
| ``init()``  |
| method that |
| accepts a   |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| object as a |
| parameter.  |
| The         |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| contains    |
| the style   |
| information |
| that the    |
| editor can  |
| edit. The   |
| other       |
| method is   |
| ``getMement |
| o``         |
| which       |
| returns a   |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| object.     |

| | ``SLDStyl |
| e``         |
| is the      |
| Style       |
| included    |
| with uDig.  |
| It is       |
| essentially |
| a adapter   |
| for         |
| Geotool's   |
| Style       |
| objects.    |
| The         |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| created by  |
| ``SLDStyle` |
| `           |
| contains    |
| two         |
| properties: |
| a ?type?    |
| property    |
| which is    |
| set to      |
| ?SLDStyle?  |
| and a       |
| ?version?   |
| property    |
| which at    |
| the time of |
| the UDIG    |
| version 1.0 |
| release is  |
| set to      |
| ?1.0?. The  |
| ``StyleMeme |
| nto``       |
| contains an |
| SLD         |
| document    |
| formatted   |
| string in   |
| its         |
| ``text``    |
| field. The  |
| SLD         |
| document    |
| can be      |
| retrieved   |
| using the   |
| ``getTextDa |
| ta()``      |
| method      |
| call.       |

| class has   |
| been        |

| 0.5         |
