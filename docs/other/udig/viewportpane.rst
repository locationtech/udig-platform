|            |
| | The      |
| ViewportPa |
| ne         |
| is the     |
| class that |
| draws the  |
| map on the |
| screen. It |
| is not     |
| responsibl |
| e          |
| for        |
| rendering, |
| it only    |
| draws the  |
| results of |
| the        |
| rendered   |
| map when   |
| it is      |
| provided   |
| with the   |
| rendered   |
| image.     |
| However it |
| is used to |
| provide    |
| feedback   |
| for the    |
| user. The  |
| tools draw |
| on the     |
| ViewportPa |
| ne,        |
| such as    |
| the zoom   |
| box, to    |
| provide    |
| the user   |
| some       |
| meaningful |
| feedback.  |
| Another    |
| example is |
| the vertex |
| manipulati |
| on         |
| tool. It   |
| draws the  |
| feature on |
| the        |
| ViewportPa |
| ne         |
| along with |
| the vertex |
| handles.   |
| |  The     |
| ViewportPa |
| ne         |
| allows     |
| listeners  |
| to         |
| register   |
| and        |
| receive    |
| events     |
| from the   |
| ViewportPa |
| ne.        |
| The event  |
| most       |
| listeners  |
| are        |
| interested |
| in are the |
| various    |
| mouse      |
| events,    |
| however    |
| there are, |
| or will    |
| be, key    |
| events as  |
| well that  |
| the        |
| ViewportPa |
| ne         |
| will       |
| issue.     |
| |  The     |
| ViewportGr |
| aphics     |
| object is  |
| the        |
| graphics   |
| object     |
| used to    |
| draw on    |
| the        |
| viewport   |
| pane. The  |
| reason a   |
| UDIG       |
| defines    |
| its own    |
| graphics   |
| object is  |
| because    |
| currently  |
| there are  |
| two        |
| VuiewportP |
| ane        |
| implementa |
| tions,     |
| one is a   |
| java       |
| canvas and |
| one is a   |
| swt        |
| canvas.    |
| The        |
| ViewportGr |
| aphics     |
| allows the |
| tools to   |
| work with  |
| both       |
| implementa |
| tions      |
| and future |
| implementa |
| tions,     |
| if they    |
| evolve.    |
