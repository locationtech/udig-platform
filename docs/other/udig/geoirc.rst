| Combine IRC with |
| a Map            |
|                  |
| This is one of   |
| those nice       |
| ideas, embedded  |
| an IRC window    |
| into a GIS       |
| Viewer. Share    |
| some "context    |
| documents" (so   |
| you look at the  |
| same thing), or  |
| share some WMS   |
| urls back and    |
| forth. There was |
| talk of a        |
| standard on the  |
| devel list, but  |
| we would have to |
| check into the   |
| details ...      |
|                  |
| Here is a couple |
| of links:        |
|                  |
| -  `Context      |
|    Documents <Co |
| ntext%20Document |
| s.html>`__       |
|    - defines the |
|    XML fragments |
|    that indicate |
|    a "layer"     |
|    currently     |
|    focused on    |
|    Web Map       |
|    Server        |
|    (pre-rendered |
|    layer), Web   |
|    Feature       |
|    Server        |
|    (vector), and |
|    Web Coverage  |
|    Service (raw  |
|    raster data), |
|    but is being  |
|    expanded on   |
|    the           |
|    osgeo-standar |
| ds               |
|    email list to |
|    cover a       |
|    google map    |
|    layer,        |
|    shapefiles    |
|    and so on as  |
|    needed        |
| -  `Gamers Own   |

|    jabber client |
|    that may be a |
|    fun starting  |
|    point (jabber |
|    should let    |
|    google        |
|    messanger     |
|    clients talk; |
|    allowing a    |
|    web based     |
|    mashup        |
|    between       |

|    messanger and |

|    several       |
|    clients       |
|    (including a  |
|    uDig based    |
|    one) sharing  |
|    context       |
|    documents via |
|    a wiki page   |
|    in order to   |
|    collaborate   |
