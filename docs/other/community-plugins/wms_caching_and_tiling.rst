| -------- |
| ---      |
|          |
| This is  |
| just a   |
| place to |
| organize |
| my plans |
| for WMS  |
| tiling   |
| and      |
| caching. |
|          |
| Caching  |
| -------  |
|          |
| I plan   |
| on       |
| implemen |
| ting     |
| client-s |
| ide      |
| caching  |
| of       |
| retrieve |
| d        |
| images.  |
| For the  |
| applicat |
| ion      |
| I am     |
| working  |
| on the   |
| data     |
| will be  |
| static,  |
| so       |
| caching  |
| will not |
| introduc |
| e        |
| any      |
| issues   |
| there.   |
| My       |
| primary  |
| motivati |
| on       |
| is to    |
| reduce   |
| latency  |
| and      |
| network  |
| load.    |
|          |
| Tiling   |
| ------   |
|          |
| This is  |
| low on   |
| the      |
| priority |
| list,    |
| but I    |
| want to  |
| build a  |
| tiling   |
| renderer |
| for WMS. |
| My       |
| thought  |
| is that  |
| it will  |
| have     |
| predefin |
| ed       |
| (or user |
| configur |
| able)    |
| grids    |
| and zoom |
| levels.  |
| This     |
| will     |
| signific |
| antly    |
| increase |
| the      |
| cache-hi |
| t        |
| rate.    |
|          |
| These    |
| images   |
| will     |
| then be  |
| tiled to |
| produce  |
| the      |
| desired  |
| viewing  |
| area. If |
| intermed |
| iate     |
| zooms    |
| are      |
| needed,  |
| then the |
| applicat |
| ion      |
| (uDig)   |
| will     |
| zoom     |
| these    |
| images   |
| appropri |
| ately.   |
| Once the |
| zoom     |
| would be |
| too      |
| pixelate |
| d,       |
| the new  |
| grid     |
| will     |
| take     |
| effect   |
| and new  |
| images   |
| will be  |
| download |
| ed.      |
