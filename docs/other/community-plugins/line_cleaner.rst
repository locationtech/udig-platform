Line Cleaner
============

Overview
--------

Line Cleaner is a tool that can be used to perform 'light-conflation' on line data. It was developed
for the BC Ministry of Forests and Range (MOFR) to clean up road data-sets that contained close but
not exact feature replication.

Line Cleaner prepares features by simplifying complex, cyclical, short and zero-length geometries,
and removing pseudo-nodes and insignificant vertices. During data preparation, node projection and
co-location ensure that feature matches can be considered atomically, not as part of a full network.

Each of the processing stages operates on a GeoTools FeatureStore. The stages are:

Processor

Description

Cycles

Search for and eliminate cycles in the data, provided they are under a set length.

DouglasPeucker

Perform `Douglas Peucker <http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/>`__ simplification
on each line.

End Nodes

Snap the ends of nearby lines together.

Minimum Length

Eliminate lines that have a length that is shorter than the provided parameter.

Node Insertion

Insert nodes at the closest point on all features. Do this before the End Nodes processor to
strategically collapse features.

Pseudo-Nodes

Removes "pseudo-nodes" by joining line features that share the same end points.

Similar Lines

Cleans out duplicate and similar features.

Installation
------------

Line Cleaner is a uDig plug-in, and can be installed using the Update Manager. Please see `Finding
new
Plug-ins <http://udig.refractions.net/help/topic/net.refractions.udig.help/html/Finding%20new%20plugins.html>`__.

It is invoked by right clicking a layer and choosing Operations->Line Cleaning
